It can be used to diagnose ERN (**E**ye **R**etinal **N**on-perfusion) and study blood flow patterns in the eye. OCTA helps researchers understand new abnormal blood vessel formation in the choroid and/or retina.  It is also a valuable tool for evaluating the prevalence of CNV (Choroidal Neovascularization) in BVMD (Background Vision Multifocal Disease). Additionally, OCTA can be used to study MNV flow patterns. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743216889, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 123, "prompt_tokens": 233, "total_tokens": 356, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
