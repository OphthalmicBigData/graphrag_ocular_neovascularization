The **placenta**, which plays a crucial role in fetal growth, is significantly impacted by IUGR. Abnormal placental angiogenesis, the process of blood vessel formation within the placenta, is often associated with IUGR. This abnormal development can lead to IUGR and negatively impact the placenta's function, ultimately affecting fetal growth.  IUGR is directly linked to abnormal placental development, highlighting its importance in fetal growth and health. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743239077, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 114, "prompt_tokens": 195, "total_tokens": 309, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
