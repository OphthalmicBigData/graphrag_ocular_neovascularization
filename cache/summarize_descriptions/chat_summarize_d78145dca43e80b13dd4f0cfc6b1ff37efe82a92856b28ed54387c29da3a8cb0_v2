It serves as a platform for investigating the mechanisms behind retinal neovascularization and retinopathy. This model utilizes mice with specific genetic modifications that mimic human conditions, allowing researchers to observe and analyze the development of these diseases in a controlled environment. The OIR mouse model provides valuable insights into the pathogenesis of retinal vascular diseases and facilitates the development of potential therapeutic strategies. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743158831, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 103, "prompt_tokens": 186, "total_tokens": 289, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
