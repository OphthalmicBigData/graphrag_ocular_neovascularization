They play a vital role in the immune response, engulfing pathogens, cellular debris, and foreign substances to protect the body from infection and damage.  These cells are also involved in wound healing, angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels), and tissue regeneration.  Macrophages contribute to both inflammation and tissue repair by releasing inflammatory mediators like OSM during cardiac fibrosis. They are essential for immune system function and can be found in various tissues throughout the body. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743238562, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 117, "prompt_tokens": 315, "total_tokens": 432, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
