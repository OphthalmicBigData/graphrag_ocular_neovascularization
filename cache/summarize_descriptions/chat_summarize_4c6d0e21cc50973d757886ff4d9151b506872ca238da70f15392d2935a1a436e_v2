This essential process plays a critical role in various physiological functions, including tissue repair, wound healing, and regenerative medicine.  It also contributes to tumor growth and metastasis by providing oxygen and nutrients to rapidly proliferating cells. \n\nWhile angiogenesis is a normal physiological process occurring constantly in mammals, its aberrant or dysregulated activity can lead to pathological changes. This process is involved in many pathological processes, including solid tumors, wet age-related macular degeneration, and chronic inflammation.  It also contributes to the growth of new blood vessels in the placenta, bone tissue, eye development, and during ischemic tissue repair. \n\nAngiogenesis is a multistep process that involves the sprouting of new vessels from pre-existing vessels. This process can be studied using various models, including transgenic zebrafish models and the DU mice model.  It is also a key factor in tumorigenesis, as it allows tumor cells to grow and spread.  Furthermore, angiogenesis is a target for therapeutic interventions, with strategies aimed at promoting blood vessel formation being explored for treating conditions like diabetic wounds. \n\nAngiogenesis is closely linked to hypoxia, an oxygen-deprived environment that triggers the process. It can be targeted to treat certain cancers, such as ccRCC (clear cell renal cell carcinoma).  Understanding and manipulating angiogenesis holds significant potential for developing new treatments for various diseases. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743303465, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 303, "prompt_tokens": 989, "total_tokens": 1292, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
