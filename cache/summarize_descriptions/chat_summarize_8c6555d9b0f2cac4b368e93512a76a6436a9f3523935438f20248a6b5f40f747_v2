This protein is crucial for angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels, and plays a significant role in vascular growth. VEGFR2 is also involved in the interaction with DCBLD2, and it's a target of the TDT-triVGB3 drug. It specifically binds to Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), making it a receptor for this angiogenic factor.  VEGFR2 is expressed on endothelial cells and tumor vessels, highlighting its importance in both healthy and pathological angiogenesis. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743328176, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 123, "prompt_tokens": 236, "total_tokens": 359, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
