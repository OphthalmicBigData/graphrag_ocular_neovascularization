This pathological process can lead to various complications, including vision loss, retinal scar tissue formation, and even blindness. CNV can be associated with age-related macular degeneration, other eye diseases, or injuries to the cornea.  It is often studied as a potential target for treatment, particularly in cases of retinal dysfunction or atrophy. \n\nCNV can manifest in different forms, including **Cataracts-like condition in the eye**, **Central vein occlusion**, and **Choroidal neovascularization (CNV)** lesions. The presence or absence of CNV is often analyzed as a clinical finding.  Researchers are also investigating its genetic basis, studying how specific gene variations contribute to the development of CNV. \n\nTreatment options for CNV typically involve systemic antibiotics and intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents. Additionally, antibody fragment therapies have been explored for their potential in treating CNV. The condition can be detected and measured through various techniques, including imaging studies like optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescein angiography. \n\n\n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743158603, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 240, "prompt_tokens": 562, "total_tokens": 802, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
