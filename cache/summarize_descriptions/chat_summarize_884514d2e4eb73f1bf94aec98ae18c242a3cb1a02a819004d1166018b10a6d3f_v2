It is a protein involved in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions like cancer. VEGF promotes blood vessel growth and oxygen supply by inducing the expression of CD40 on human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs).  It is also a type of medication used to treat eye diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration. \n\nVEGF levels are often increased in response to injury or disease, including cancer. Studies have shown that VEGF mRNA expression is consistent with secreted levels, indicating its active role in angiogenesis. Downregulation of VEGF has been observed in ischemic hindlimbs of SNx mice, highlighting its importance in blood vessel development and function.  Furthermore, VEGF is a growth factor that regulates angiogenesis and tumor growth. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743287061, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 178, "prompt_tokens": 461, "total_tokens": 639, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
