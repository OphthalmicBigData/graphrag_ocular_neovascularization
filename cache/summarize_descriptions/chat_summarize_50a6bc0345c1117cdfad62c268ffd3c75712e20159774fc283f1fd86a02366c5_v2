It acts as a receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family members, including VEGF-A, and VEGFC. This binding triggers downstream signaling pathways, leading to the proliferation, migration, and survival of endothelial cells, which are essential components of blood vessels. \n\nVEGFR2 is involved in **tumor growth and progression**, making it a target for cancer treatment.  It's also implicated in **cell signaling** and **vascular development**.  Research has shown its involvement in angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, which is crucial for tissue repair and tumor growth.  \n\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* **Function:** Receptor tyrosine kinase involved in angiogenesis\n* **Target:** VEGF-A (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A) and VEGFC \n* **Role:** Promotes endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and survival\n* **Clinical Relevance:** Potential target for cancer treatment due to its role in tumor growth. \n\n\n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743087961, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 236, "prompt_tokens": 429, "total_tokens": 665, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
