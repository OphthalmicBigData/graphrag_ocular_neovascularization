It involves the development of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, playing a vital role in tissue repair and organ morphogenesis during development.  \n\nThis process is essential for several key processes: \n* **Tissue Repair:** Angiogenesis facilitates wound healing by supplying oxygen and nutrients to damaged tissues. \n* **Organ Development:** It contributes to the growth and development of organs throughout life, including breast cancer. \n* **Tumor Growth:** Angiogenesis plays a critical role in tumor growth and metastasis, as tumors require a constant supply of blood vessels for their survival and spread.  \n* **Bone Remodeling:** Angiogenesis is involved in bone remodeling, contributing to bone repair and regeneration. \n\n**Angiogenesis Mechanisms:** \nThe process can be triggered by various factors, including tissue injury or disease, tumor growth, and even exercise-induced effects. It involves the activation of specific signaling pathways that lead to the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, the building blocks of blood vessels.  \n\n**Clinical Significance:** \nDysregulation of angiogenesis is implicated in over 70 human diseases, highlighting its importance in maintaining health. Understanding the mechanisms of angiogenesis has led to the development of new therapeutic strategies for treating various conditions, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and wound healing disorders.\n\n\nIn summary, **angiogenesis** is a complex biological process that plays a critical role in numerous physiological functions, from tissue repair and organ development to tumor growth and metastasis.  Understanding its mechanisms and regulation holds immense potential for developing novel therapeutic interventions for a wide range of diseases. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743089684, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 353, "prompt_tokens": 818, "total_tokens": 1171, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
