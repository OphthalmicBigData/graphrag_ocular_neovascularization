It plays a role in regulating cell proliferation and migration, and its circulating form has been studied in relation to **BMECs** (bone marrow endothelial cells). \n\nSpecifically, CIRCHIPK3 is implicated in the following:\n* **Cell growth regulation:** It acts as a regulator of cell growth.\n* **Angiogenesis:** CIRCHIPK3 contributes to the development and formation of new blood vessels.\n* **Osteoarthritis:** CIRCHIPK3 plays a role in the development of osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease. \n* **Circulating HIPK3:**  The protein is found circulating in the bloodstream, potentially influencing cell behavior and migration.\n\n\nIt's important to note that there may be some contradictions or conflicting information within the provided descriptions.
