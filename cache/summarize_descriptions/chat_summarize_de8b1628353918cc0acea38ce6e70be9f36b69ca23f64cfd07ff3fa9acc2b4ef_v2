They line blood vessels and play a crucial role in forming new blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. HUVECs are widely used in research due to their ability to form functional blood vessels in vitro. They are also utilized in the development of biomaterials like the VEGF-PDA/KGM scaffold for tissue engineering applications.  HUVECs have been extensively studied for their role in various physiological and pathological processes, including angiogenesis, wound healing, and tumor growth. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743303483, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 130, "prompt_tokens": 265, "total_tokens": 395, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
