It acts as a receptor for the VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) signaling pathway, which is essential for the formation of new blood vessels. VEGFR2 is involved in various physiological processes, including the development and maintenance of blood vessels, particularly in ischemic brain conditions.  It's considered a pro-angiogenic receptor, meaning it promotes angiogenesis by triggering cellular responses that lead to the growth of new blood vessels. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743328300, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 118, "prompt_tokens": 224, "total_tokens": 342, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
