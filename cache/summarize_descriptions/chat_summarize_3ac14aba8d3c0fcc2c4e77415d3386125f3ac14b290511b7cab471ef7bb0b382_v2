They are recruited to sites of injury, such as the hindlimbs of rats, where they can be injected to promote healing and regeneration. MSCs have the ability to differentiate into various cell types, making them promising candidates for tissue repair and regenerative medicine. Research on MSCs focuses on their proliferation and treatment with EPAG (a specific compound) to enhance angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels) and vascular density.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743328347, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 116, "prompt_tokens": 217, "total_tokens": 333, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
