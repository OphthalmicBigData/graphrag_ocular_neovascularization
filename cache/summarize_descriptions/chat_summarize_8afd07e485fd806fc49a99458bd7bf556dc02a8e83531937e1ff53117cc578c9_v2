It can manifest as a lack of oxygen or a deprivation of sufficient oxygen levels.  This condition, often described as a prolonged hypoxic condition, is prevalent in various contexts such as solid tumors where oxygen scarcity is common. \\n\\nDescriptions of hypoxia range from \\\"a condition of low oxygen levels\\\" to \\\"the condition studied extensively.\\\" The **hypoxia** condition refers to a state of low oxygen levels in the body's tissues. This can be characterized by an air composition with 1.2% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide, balanced with nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>).  This imbalance leads to a lack of sufficient oxygen for proper cellular function, resulting in various health complications. \\n\", \"**Hypoxia** is a condition characterized by insufficient oxygen supply to cells, tissues, or the entire body.
