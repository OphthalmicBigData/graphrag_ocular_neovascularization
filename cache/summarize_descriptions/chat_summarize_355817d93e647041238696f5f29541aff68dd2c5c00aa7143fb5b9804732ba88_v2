Stimulation of VEGF-A leads to an upregulation of its own expression, further promoting angiogenesis. \\n\\nVEGF-A protein is a crucial player in blood vessel growth and development. It acts as a potent promoter of vascular formation, playing a significant role in neovascularization – the process of new blood vessel formation.
