This restriction can lead to tissue damage and potentially limb loss.  A mouse model of hindlimb ischemia was created by ablating the femoral artery in mice, which disrupts blood flow to the hindlimbs.  This model allows researchers to study the effects of hindlimb ischemia on various physiological processes.  In addition, studies have shown that ischemia in the hindlimbs of mice is a relevant model for understanding human conditions like peripheral arterial disease (PAD). \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743328377, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 118, "prompt_tokens": 199, "total_tokens": 317, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
