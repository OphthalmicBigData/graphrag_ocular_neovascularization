It is a medical imaging technique that can be used to measure flow area and density, detect choroidal neovascularization (CNV), and analyze retinal vascular features. OCTA is also a possible diagnosis tool for Caucasian patients.  The technique uses optical coherence tomography to capture detailed images of the retina and surrounding structures, including blood vessels in the eye. It is often used to study the ciliary body and visualize the retina. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743087882, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 118, "prompt_tokens": 393, "total_tokens": 511, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
