They are responsible for forming new blood vessels (angiogenesis) and maintaining the structural integrity of blood vessels. Endothelial cells line the inner surface of blood vessels, contributing to blood vessel formation and growth. They also play a vital role in wound healing by regulating blood flow and promoting tissue repair. \n\nEndothelial cells are found in various locations, including the blood vessels of the eye, brain tumor-bearing mice, and the blood vessel wall.  They are essential for maintaining healthy blood circulation and overall vascular function. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743087880, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 128, "prompt_tokens": 351, "total_tokens": 479, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
