They are essential components of the tumor microenvironment and are studied to understand various biological processes, including blood vessel development and transport of kynurenine. These cells are also important for research on ARL13B, as they were studied in relation to this protein. Endothelial cells form tubules and line the inner surface of blood vessels, contributing significantly to their structure and function.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743182544, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 106, "prompt_tokens": 307, "total_tokens": 413, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
