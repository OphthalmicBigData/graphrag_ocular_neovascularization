It serves as an experimental setting for investigating anti-angiogenesis and studying the development of blood vessels. The CAM can be used to test the effects of drugs or other substances on angiogenesis, and it's also a model for studying the growth and behavior of cells. \n\nThe **CAM** is derived from a chick embryo's chorioallantoic membrane, which is a tissue found in the developing embryo.
