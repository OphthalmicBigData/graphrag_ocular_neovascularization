They are involved in fighting infections, removing cellular debris, and contributing to wound healing. Macrophages are also found in the **tumor microenvironment**, where they interact with other immune cells and can influence tumor growth. \\n\\nMacrophages are known for their ability to produce growth factors, which contribute to tissue repair and regeneration.  They are particularly important in inflammation, where they respond to signals from injured tissues or pathogens. Macrophages are also affected by the surrounding environment, including interactions with **normal vs. cancer-associated fibroblasts**. \\n\\nIn summary, macrophages are essential immune cells that play a multifaceted role in both health and disease. \\n\", \"Macrophages are immune cells that play a crucial role in various physiological processes, including the immune response, inflammation, and tissue repair. They are essential components of the immune system, engulfing and destroying pathogens as part of their function.  Furthermore, macrophages contribute to bone formation and repair, angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels), and regulate the development of age-related macular degeneration. Their immunoregulatory effects influence the progression of various diseases, including those related to CNV (choroidal neovascularization). Macrophages are also involved in HIF signaling pathways, highlighting their complex role in cellular processes. \\n\\nIn addition to these roles, macrophages play a significant part in tumor growth and metastasis.
