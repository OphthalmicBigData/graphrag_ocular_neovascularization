It's used to assess eye health and track changes in vision over time, particularly after treatment or intervention. BCVA considers the patient's best corrected vision, which means it accounts for the use of eyeglasses or contact lenses to improve visual clarity. This measurement is often used as a baseline for further assessments and can be compared to previous measurements to monitor progress. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743087989, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 111, "prompt_tokens": 273, "total_tokens": 384, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
