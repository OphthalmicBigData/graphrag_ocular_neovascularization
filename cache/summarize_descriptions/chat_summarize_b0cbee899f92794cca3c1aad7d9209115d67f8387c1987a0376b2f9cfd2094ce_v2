This process, also known as tube formation, can be studied using various assays and methods.  It encompasses the angiogenesis process, where new blood vessels form tubes to deliver oxygen and nutrients to tissues. The **tube formation assay** is used to evaluate in-vitro changes in angiogenesis, measuring how cells migrate and form tubes. This method provides insights into cell migration and tube formation, which are crucial for understanding various biological processes like wound healing and tumor growth.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743158731, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 114, "prompt_tokens": 202, "total_tokens": 316, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
