It is a crucial component of the eye, playing a vital role in vision processing and where light is converted into electrical signals that are sent to the brain for interpretation.  The retina is also part of the eye affected by infrared (IR) radiation. This tissue undergoes angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, which is essential for healthy vision. The retina is where vision is processed, making it a key area of study in ophthalmology. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743141736, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 109, "prompt_tokens": 229, "total_tokens": 338, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
