It is primarily known for its involvement in angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels. VEGFR2 acts as a receptor tyrosine kinase, meaning it receives signals from other molecules and triggers cellular responses. This protein interacts with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) ligands, particularly VEGF-A, to promote angiogenesis. \n\nVEGFR2 is also implicated in tumor growth and progression. It contributes to the development of new blood vessels that supply nutrients and oxygen to tumors, facilitating their growth.  Furthermore, VEGFR2 regulates vascular growth by influencing the formation and maturation of blood vessels.  It's important to note that VEGFR2 can promote degradation of other proteins, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular processes. \n\nThe protein is also known as KDR (kinase domain-containing receptor) and is a key component of the vascular system. It acts as a receptor for VEGF-A, which is a signaling molecule involved in angiogenesis and vascular development.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743216826, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 214, "prompt_tokens": 274, "total_tokens": 488, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
