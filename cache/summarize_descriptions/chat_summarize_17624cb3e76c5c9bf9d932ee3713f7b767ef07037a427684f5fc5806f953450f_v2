This intricate environment plays a crucial role in influencing tumor growth, progression, and response to treatment.  It includes blood vessels that grow within the TME, cells from both the tumor itself and the body's immune system, as well as fluids and other factors that contribute to its complexity. The TME is often described as a \"complex system\" of cells and tissues surrounding the tumor, where interactions between cancer cells and immune cells are particularly significant.  The study of the TME is essential for understanding how tumors develop and respond to therapy, making it a key area of research in oncology. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743141768, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 145, "prompt_tokens": 279, "total_tokens": 424, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
