It involves separating proteins based on their molecular weight using gel electrophoresis and then transferring them to a membrane.  Antibodies specific to the target proteins are then applied to the membrane, followed by detection of bound antibodies using various methods like chemiluminescence or fluorescence. This allows researchers to identify and quantify the presence and levels of specific proteins within a sample. The Western blot technique is particularly useful for studying protein expression, phosphorylation status (e.g., p-Akt), and other signaling pathways related to CX3CR1, Akt, Erk1/2, and VEGF.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743286982, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 131, "prompt_tokens": 222, "total_tokens": 353, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
