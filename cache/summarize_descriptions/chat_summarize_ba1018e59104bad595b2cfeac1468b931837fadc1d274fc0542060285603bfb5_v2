It has been employed extensively in investigations of psoriasis, where it serves as a platform to understand the disease's mechanisms and test potential treatments.  Additionally, mouse models are utilized to evaluate devices and assess their functionality. The **mouse model** is also relevant to research on oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR), a condition that mimics human retinal diseases. Finally, mouse models have been employed in studies of skin expansion, providing insights into the biological processes involved. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743287092, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 116, "prompt_tokens": 175, "total_tokens": 291, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
