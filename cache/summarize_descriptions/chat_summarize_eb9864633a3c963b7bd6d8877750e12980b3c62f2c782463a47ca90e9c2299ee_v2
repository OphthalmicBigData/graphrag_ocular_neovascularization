The **RAT MODEL** has been employed extensively to study conditions such as Chronic Inflammatory Retinopathy (CIRI), where it's used to investigate the effects of treatments like TLB on CIRI. It is also utilized for researching placental angiogenesis and the impact of bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept on corneal neovascularization.  Furthermore, the **Rat Model** serves as a crucial tool in research related to CTEPH (Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension), allowing scientists to understand and investigate the mechanisms of this complex disease.
