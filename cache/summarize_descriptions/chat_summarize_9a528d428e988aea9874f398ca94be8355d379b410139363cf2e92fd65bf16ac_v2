It may also have alleviative effects on heart function and myocardial infarction (MI).  Research suggests naringenin provides protective effects against myocardial ischemia and reperfusion, suggesting it could be beneficial in treating these conditions. Additionally, studies indicate that naringenin increases viability in hypoxic human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), highlighting its potential for promoting cell survival under oxygen-deprived conditions. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743182614, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 100, "prompt_tokens": 196, "total_tokens": 296, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
