It plays a crucial role in cell growth and development, acting as a **growth factor** that promotes angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels.  VEGFA is a signaling pathway component and a gene that codes for a protein involved in angiogenesis. This protein stimulates angiogenesis and contributes to tumor growth. \n\nIt's important to note that VEGFA can act independently or as part of a larger signaling pathway. It regulates vascular development and plays a significant role in cancer progression.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743286980, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 136, "prompt_tokens": 385, "total_tokens": 521, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
