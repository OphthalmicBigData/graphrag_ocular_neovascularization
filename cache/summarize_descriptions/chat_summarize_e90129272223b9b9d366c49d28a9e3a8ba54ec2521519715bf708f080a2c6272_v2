It is a key growth factor studied for its potential therapeutic applications. VEGFA promotes angiogenesis by stimulating the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, which are responsible for forming new blood vessel walls. It has been identified as a target for anti-angiogenic therapies aimed at inhibiting tumor growth and other pathological conditions where excessive angiogenesis occurs.  Research on VEGFA's role in various biological processes is ongoing, including gene expression analysis related to vascular development. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743328224, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 135, "prompt_tokens": 294, "total_tokens": 429, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
