This assay assesses cell tube-forming abilities and helps researchers understand how cells grow and migrate. It's also a tool for measuring angiogenic capability, meaning the ability of cells to form tubes in response to specific stimuli.  The **TUBE FORMATION ASSAY** is often used to study cell behavior and its role in various biological processes like wound healing and tumor growth. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743255603, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 104, "prompt_tokens": 204, "total_tokens": 308, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
