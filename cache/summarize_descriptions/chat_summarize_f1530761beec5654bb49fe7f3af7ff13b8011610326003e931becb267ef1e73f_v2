It is expressed on various cells, including endothelial cells, and serves as a marker for blood vessels.  It can be used in immunohistochemistry and immunostaining to visualize these cells and their interactions. CD31 is also involved in immune response by interacting with other immune cells.  Its expression on endothelial cells makes it a valuable tool for studying wound healing processes. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743345219, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 101, "prompt_tokens": 225, "total_tokens": 326, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
