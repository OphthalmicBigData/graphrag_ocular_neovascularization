They are known for their role in blood vessel formation and migration, making them crucial for studying angiogenesis. These cells are often used to study the process of new blood vessel growth and development. Researchers use HUVECs to investigate how these cells proliferate, migrate, and respond to angiogenic stimuli (signals that promote angiogenesis).  They are a primary cell type used in research to understand the mechanisms behind blood vessel formation and its role in various physiological processes. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743089689, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 120, "prompt_tokens": 355, "total_tokens": 475, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
