This technique allows for the detection of specific molecules or proteins within cells and tissues using antibodies that bind to target molecules, followed by fluorescent dyes for visualization under a microscope. Immunofluorescence can be applied to study various biological processes such as angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels), neurogenesis (development of new neurons), wound healing, and other biological processes. It is also used to study PGF expression (prostaglandin F2α) and visualize cell structures.
