It serves as an animal model to investigate diverse biological phenomena, including the effects of specific drugs and treatments on various physiological processes.  \n\nSome notable applications include studying the impact of honokiol on choroidal neovascularization, investigating dapagliflozin's effect on limb ischemia, and examining placental development in mice. The **MOUSE MODEL** is also employed to study gastric cancer using genetic modifications, explore the effects of AAV8 vector on CNV, and investigate the consequences of oxygen-induced retinopathy.  \n\nFurthermore, certain **MOUSE MODELS** are specifically designed for studying tumor growth, such as those used in xenograft studies with subcutaneously injected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells. \n\n\n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743255606, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 161, "prompt_tokens": 249, "total_tokens": 410, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
