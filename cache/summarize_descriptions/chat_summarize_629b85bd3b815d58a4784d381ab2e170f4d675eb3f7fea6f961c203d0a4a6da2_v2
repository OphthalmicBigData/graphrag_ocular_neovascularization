It's also a key component of the circulatory system, responsible for pumping blood to all parts of the organism.  This organ is often studied in both humans and animals, including rats, where researchers have investigated its tissue structure and function. The heart is particularly important in understanding conditions like coronary heart disease and cardiac hypertrophy.  Research on the **heart** has also focused on specific signaling pathways such as FGFR1-β-KL, highlighting its complex biological functions. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743238639, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 119, "prompt_tokens": 223, "total_tokens": 342, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
