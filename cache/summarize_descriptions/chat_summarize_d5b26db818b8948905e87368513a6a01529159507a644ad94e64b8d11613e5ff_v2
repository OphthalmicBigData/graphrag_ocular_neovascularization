This process can be assessed through various methods, including assays used to evaluate angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels) of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). These assays measure cell proliferation and cell migration, providing insights into the ability of cells to form tubes in vitro.  Tube formation is also a method for analyzing cells and assessing their ability to form tube-like structures. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743182503, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 100, "prompt_tokens": 206, "total_tokens": 306, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
