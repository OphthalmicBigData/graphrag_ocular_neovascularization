They contribute to inflammation and tissue repair, and are integral components of the immune response. These cells actively participate in wound healing and engulf pathogens, forming a protective barrier in the synovium. \n\nMacrophages play a crucial role in regulating inflammation and influencing angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels). They release factors that stimulate neovascularization, contributing to bone formation, regeneration, and maintenance.  Furthermore, macrophages are involved in both inflammatory responses and tissue repair processes. \n\n\n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743345230, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 134, "prompt_tokens": 338, "total_tokens": 472, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
