This area, often referred to as the **tumor's immediate vicinity**, includes immune and stromal cells, blood vessels, and other cells that interact with the tumor itself.  It is also where angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, occurs. The TME plays a crucial role in tumor growth, influencing cell interactions, communication, and ultimately, the tumor's progression. It is often described as the **area surrounding a tumor** where cells interact and influence each other, impacting their behavior and overall development.  The TME can be studied in various contexts, including mouse models, to understand how tumors interact with their environment and develop. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743328233, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 150, "prompt_tokens": 322, "total_tokens": 472, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
