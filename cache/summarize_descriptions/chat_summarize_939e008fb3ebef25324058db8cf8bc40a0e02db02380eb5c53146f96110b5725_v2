This method assesses cell growth and organization in vitro (in a laboratory setting) and helps researchers study how tubes form.  It can be used to evaluate the pro-angiogenic potential of cells, meaning their ability to promote new blood vessel growth. The tube formation assay is an experiment that evaluates the ability of cells to form tubes in a controlled environment. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743141809, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 99, "prompt_tokens": 241, "total_tokens": 340, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
