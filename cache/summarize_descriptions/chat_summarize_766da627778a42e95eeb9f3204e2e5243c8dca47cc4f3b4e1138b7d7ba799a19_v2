Further research is needed to determine the precise impact of SHRM on predicting prognosis and guiding treatment for CNV.  SHRM has been instrumental in recognizing active CNV, and it serves as a study area for analyzing blood flow at the CNV site using OCT angiography. This technique allows researchers to evaluate flow signals and differentiate true Type 2 macular neovascularization from pseudo classic CNV. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743090429, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 114, "prompt_tokens": 214, "total_tokens": 328, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
