They are involved in fighting infection and inflammation by engulfing and destroying pathogens. Macrophages are also essential for angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels) and vascular remodeling, which is important for tissue repair and regeneration. \n\nSpecifically, they are found in high-risk groups and play a role in the immune response within CNV lesions from patients with nAMD.  Macrophages contribute to both innate and adaptive immunity by participating in wound healing and fighting infection. They are also involved in the complex process of angiogenesis and vascular remodeling, which is essential for tissue repair and regeneration following injury or disease. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743216898, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 154, "prompt_tokens": 232, "total_tokens": 386, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
