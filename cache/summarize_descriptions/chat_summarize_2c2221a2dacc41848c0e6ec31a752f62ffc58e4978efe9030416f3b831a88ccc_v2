They are involved in fighting infections, removing cellular debris, and contributing to wound healing. Macrophages are also found in the **tumor microenvironment**, where they interact with other immune cells and can influence tumor growth. \n\nMacrophages are known for their ability to produce growth factors, which contribute to tissue repair and regeneration.  They are particularly important in inflammation, where they respond to signals from injured tissues or pathogens. Macrophages are also affected by the surrounding environment, including interactions with **normal vs. cancer-associated fibroblasts**. \n\nIn summary, macrophages are essential immune cells that play a multifaceted role in both health and disease. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743286998, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 162, "prompt_tokens": 261, "total_tokens": 423, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
