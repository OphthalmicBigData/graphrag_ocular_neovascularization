They serve as subjects in laboratory settings for research purposes, such as investigating genetic mutations, disease mechanisms, and drug development. Mice have been utilized in numerous experiments, including those exploring Foxp1 and CNV, and are often used as subjects in studies exploring various biological processes. The mouse is also a common animal model for studying wound healing, glioma, and retinal development.  They have been employed in research to study the effects of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AS) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI).  Mice are particularly valuable in research due to their genetic similarities to humans, making them suitable models for studying human health conditions. Specific applications include: researching disease, testing new treatments, studying the effects of resveratrol, investigating PBMT, studying glioma tumors, and investigating the effects of nickel on the immune system. \\n\", \"The **mouse** is a widely used animal model in research, particularly for studying human biology and disease.
