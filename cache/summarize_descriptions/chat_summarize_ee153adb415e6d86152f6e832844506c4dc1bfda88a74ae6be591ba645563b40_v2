It covers the front part of the eye and plays a crucial role in focusing light onto the retina.  It's a key component of the eye, responsible for its transparency and ability to refract light. The cornea is also susceptible to inflammatory angiogenesis, meaning it can be affected by inflammation and blood vessel growth. This tissue was divided into four quadrants for analysis, and the study was conducted in the part of the eye that Ibrate treats. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743216836, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 107, "prompt_tokens": 223, "total_tokens": 330, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
