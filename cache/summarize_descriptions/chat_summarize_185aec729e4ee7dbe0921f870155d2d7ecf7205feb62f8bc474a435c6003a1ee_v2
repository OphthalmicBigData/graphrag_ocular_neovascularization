They have emerged as potential therapeutic vectors for delivering drug cargoes to diseased cells. For example, EVs were reported as a new treatment for diabetic wounds by delivering VH298 into endothelial cells. These vesicles can be derived from various sources, including cell-secreted soluble factors and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Extracellular vesicles are involved in various clinical disorders and have the potential to revolutionize disease treatment. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743141815, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 118, "prompt_tokens": 227, "total_tokens": 345, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
