It can lead to cell death and significantly limits wound healing.  It is often described as a state of low oxygen levels, where the body is deprived of oxygen. This deprivation can trigger various physiological responses, including increased expression of PRMT5 and enhanced angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels) by ASCs (adipose-derived stem cells). Hypoxia-conditioned-ASC-loaded collagen scaffolds have been investigated for their potential in promoting wound healing.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743238512, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 111, "prompt_tokens": 242, "total_tokens": 353, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
