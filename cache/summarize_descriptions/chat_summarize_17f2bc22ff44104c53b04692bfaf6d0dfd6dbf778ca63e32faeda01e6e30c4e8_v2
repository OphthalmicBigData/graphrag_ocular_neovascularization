It regulates various physiological processes, including cell growth, development, angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels), and cell survival under hypoxic conditions. HIF-1α is activated by hypoxia and triggers the expression of genes involved in these processes.  It acts as a central regulator of cellular responses to hypoxia, influencing both the immediate adaptation to low oxygen levels and long-term adjustments for optimal function. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743328239, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 113, "prompt_tokens": 349, "total_tokens": 462, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
