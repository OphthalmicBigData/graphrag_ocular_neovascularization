They play crucial roles in various physiological processes, including angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels), and are involved in the pathology of conditions like central venous insufficiency (CNV). These cells are studied extensively in research, particularly in the context of retinal vascular development and disease. They form a lining of blood vessels, contributing to their structural integrity and function.  Endothelial cells are also essential for maintaining the inner surface of blood vessels, ensuring proper blood flow and nutrient delivery throughout the body. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743087890, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 120, "prompt_tokens": 295, "total_tokens": 415, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
