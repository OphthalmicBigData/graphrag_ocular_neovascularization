They play a crucial role in angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, and are involved in both blood vessel formation and repair. Endothelial cells are key players in the cardiovascular system and contribute to blood supply, bone repair, and inflammation. They are also essential for studying cancer as they are used in 3D biomimetic models.  Endothelial cells are involved in angiogenesis and glycolysis, and their function is critical for maintaining healthy blood vessels.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743343533, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 119, "prompt_tokens": 394, "total_tokens": 513, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
