It functions as a **growth factor** and **angiogenic factor**, meaning it promotes the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis).  VEGFA is involved in cell signaling, contributing to both healthy tissue development and disease progression. \n\nWhile VEGFA is essential for normal angiogenesis, its role in tumor growth is complex. It can promote tumor growth but also contribute to anti-tumor responses. Additionally, VEGFA has been linked to **miscarriage risk** as a protein found in serum that might predict the likelihood of miscarriage.  Furthermore, it's involved in neuroprotection and brain tissue damage studies. \n\n\n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743255645, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 156, "prompt_tokens": 251, "total_tokens": 407, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
