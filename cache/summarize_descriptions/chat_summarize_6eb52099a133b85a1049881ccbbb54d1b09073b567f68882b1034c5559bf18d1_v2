It works by using antibodies that specifically bind to the target protein of interest, which are then labeled with fluorescent dyes. This allows for the visualization of the protein's location and distribution within the cell under a microscope.  Immunofluorescence can be used to study various cellular processes and structures. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743087972, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 78, "prompt_tokens": 158, "total_tokens": 236, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
