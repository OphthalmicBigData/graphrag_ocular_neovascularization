It acts as a **proangiogenic factor**, promoting blood vessel growth and development. VEGF is involved in various biological processes, including cell signaling, cell growth, and tumor growth.  \n\nIt's a key player in both healthy physiological processes like blood vessel formation and pathological conditions such as tumor development.  VEGF is often measured to evaluate angiogenesis capacity, particularly in research related to vision loss treatment and cancer. \n\nThe **VEGF pathway** is also implicated in the activity of other molecules like Osteopontin (OPN).  Loss of a single VEGF gene (vegfa) results in embryonic lethality in mice due to defective vascularization.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743303470, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 162, "prompt_tokens": 531, "total_tokens": 693, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
