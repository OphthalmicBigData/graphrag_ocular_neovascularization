Studies have shown that SIRT1 deacetylated SOX9, leading to its nuclear translocation. This process inhibits the viability of human retinal pigment epithelial cells and promotes cell apoptosis and angiogenesis, ultimately contributing to the formation of CNV (choroidal neovascularization) - a key factor in AMD progression. Additionally, research indicates that SIRT1 directly contributes to the development of AMD by promoting CNV-induced AMD formation. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743158900, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 109, "prompt_tokens": 197, "total_tokens": 306, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
