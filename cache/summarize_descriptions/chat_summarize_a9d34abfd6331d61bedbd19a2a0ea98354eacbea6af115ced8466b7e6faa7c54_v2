It is involved in cell growth and development, as well as blood-retina barrier formation.  Specifically, FOXC1 has been linked to glioma cell growth, making it an important target for research into this type of brain tumor. The gene's function extends to retinal angiogenesis, where it is essential for the formation of new blood vessels in the retina. Notably, FOXC1 expression is often upregulated in glioma cells, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743303567, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 117, "prompt_tokens": 225, "total_tokens": 342, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
