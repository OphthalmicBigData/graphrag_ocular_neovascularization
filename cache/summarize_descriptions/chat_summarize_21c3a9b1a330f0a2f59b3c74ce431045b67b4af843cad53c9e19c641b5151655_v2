This assay can be used to evaluate the ability of cells to form tubes or channels in vitro.  It is often employed as part of studies investigating angiogenesis, a process crucial for tissue growth and repair. The **TUBE FORMATION** assay has been utilized to assess the activity of PDIA4 protein, which plays a role in angiogenesis. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743238517, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 103, "prompt_tokens": 207, "total_tokens": 310, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
