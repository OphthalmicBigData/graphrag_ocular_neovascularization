It can manifest as low oxygen levels (hypoxia) and lead to various physiological effects.  It can result from a variety of factors including damage to tissues, such as those caused by ischemia or injury, leading to a lack of oxygen in the affected areas. Hypoxia is also studied in experiments where subjects are deprived of oxygen, known as hypoxia exposure. This condition has been implicated in mechanisms related to angiogenesis (blood vessel formation) and the development of diseases like atherosclerosis, where plaque destabilization occurs.  Hypoxia can induce retinal neovascularization, a process that involves the growth of new blood vessels in the retina. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743158613, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 150, "prompt_tokens": 357, "total_tokens": 507, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
