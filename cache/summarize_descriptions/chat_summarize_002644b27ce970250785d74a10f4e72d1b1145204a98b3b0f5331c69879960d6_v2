It can occur in various tissues and organs, including the retina, cornea, skin, and central nervous system. \\n\\n**Applications:**\\n\\n* **Retinal Health:** Neovascularization plays a role in preventing the progression of retinal diseases like retinopathy and outer retinal atrophy.  \\n* **Diabetic Complications:** It is also involved in improving the diabetic microenvironment by reducing complications associated with diabetes.\\n* **Central Nervous System:** Active neovascularization can be observed in the central nervous system, impacting its function. \\n* **Eye Surgery:** Neovascularization is a factor in the formation of new blood vessels after cataract surgery, particularly in the iris.  \\n* **Wound Healing:**  Neovascularization is involved in increased blood vessel growth at wound sites, contributing to tissue repair and regeneration.\\n\\n**Methods & Treatments:**\\n\\n* **PRP Treatment:** Neovascularization can be stimulated by platelet-rich plasma (PRP) treatment, leading to increased blood vessel formation. \\n\\n\\n**Contradictions:** While some descriptions mention neovascularization in the central nervous system, others focus on its role in the retina and cornea.
