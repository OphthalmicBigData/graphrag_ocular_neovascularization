It works by using light waves to create cross-sectional images of the retina, optic nerve, and other structures within the eye. OCT can be used to evaluate various conditions, including foveal neovascularization, which refers to abnormal blood vessel growth in the center of the retina.  There are different types of OCT, such as spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), which provides high-resolution images. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743343624, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 109, "prompt_tokens": 176, "total_tokens": 285, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
