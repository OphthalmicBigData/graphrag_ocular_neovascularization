It is involved in both **vascular function** and **neovascularization**, which refers to the growth of new blood vessels. VEGFA promotes angiogenesis by stimulating endothelial cells, the cells lining blood vessels, to proliferate and migrate.  It also plays a role in **cell growth and development**. \n\nVEGFA has potential applications in treating inflammatory diseases due to its ability to modulate immune responses. It is a key component of the **signaling pathway** known as **unsynchronized RPE cells**, which are involved in retinal function.  Furthermore, VEGFA is a research organization and is also referred to as **Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor**. \n\n\n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743345217, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 168, "prompt_tokens": 260, "total_tokens": 428, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
