It is associated with a hazard ratio of 2.551 in relation to MVD (Mitral Valve Disease) and FIGO stage, indicating its potential influence on disease progression.  Furthermore, PRX2 has been identified as a potential biomarker for predicting the progression and prognosis of **CSCC** (Carcinoid Tumors). This protein is also upregulated in CSCC tissues, suggesting its involvement in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Notably, PRX2 exhibits a dual role in these processes, contributing to both tumor development and advancement. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743328438, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 136, "prompt_tokens": 219, "total_tokens": 355, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
