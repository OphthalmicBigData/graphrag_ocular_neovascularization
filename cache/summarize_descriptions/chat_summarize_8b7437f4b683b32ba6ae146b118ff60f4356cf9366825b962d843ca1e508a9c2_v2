It can occur due to various factors, including reduced blood flow or impaired gas exchange.  It can also affect the stability of VEGFR2 and DIXDC1 proteins. Hypoxia is a significant factor in tumor development as it creates a hypoxic microenvironment that stimulates angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels) for increased oxygen supply. It can also contribute to pulmonary hypertension, a condition where blood pressure in the lungs increases.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743088031, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 108, "prompt_tokens": 239, "total_tokens": 347, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
