It can cause vision loss and is often associated with other retinal conditions like Stargardt disease and age-related macular degeneration (AMD).  MNV is characterized by damage to the blood vessels in the macula, leading to inflammation and potential vision impairment. \n\nWhile MNV can be a rare complication of certain genetic disorders such as choroideraemia and rod-cone dystrophies, it can also occur independently. It's important to note that MNV is often diagnosed through medical examinations and follow-up assessments, particularly when the condition progresses to a more severe form known as T3 MNV (T3 Macular Neurovascular degeneration). \n\n\n**Note:** The term \"MNV\" can be used interchangeably with other terms like \"Myopic macular neuropathy,\" \"Myopic macular neovascularization,\" or \"Multi-nucleated virus.\"  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743255705, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 206, "prompt_tokens": 253, "total_tokens": 459, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
