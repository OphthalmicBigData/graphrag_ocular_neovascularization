These cells are crucial for research, particularly in the fields of angiogenesis and cell migration/proliferation.  They play a vital role in blood vessel formation and are used as a cellular model to study various biological processes like hypoxia treatment and cell viability. HUVECs are commonly employed in co-culture experiments with other cell types such as HT-ASC-EVs and ASC-EVs, allowing for the investigation of their interactions and effects on angiogenesis.  Their use in biomedical research stems from their ability to mimic the function of endothelial cells found in blood vessels, making them a valuable tool for understanding vascular development and disease. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743158596, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 159, "prompt_tokens": 322, "total_tokens": 481, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
