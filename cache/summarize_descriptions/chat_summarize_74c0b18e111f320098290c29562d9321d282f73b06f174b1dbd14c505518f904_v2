It serves as an animal model for studying various biological processes, including those related to human diseases.  Specifically, mice are often used to investigate the VEGF signaling pathway and other aspects of mammalian biology. They are also frequently employed in experiments to understand how different biological processes work.  Mice can be either male or female, and they are a common choice for research due to their genetic similarities to humans. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743343514, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 96, "prompt_tokens": 256, "total_tokens": 352, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
