CNV is a condition characterized by the growth of new blood vessels in the retina, which can cause vision loss. It is often associated with other eye diseases like **Cataract** and **Congenital Neuropathy Vision**. CNV can be seen on an eye scan and may lead to complications such as **regrowth of blood vessels after a treatment**, or **secondary CNV regressed**.  CNV is also being studied for its connection to **neovascular AMD** and its potential role in the progression of other diseases. \n\nThe condition can be caused by various factors, including **CSCR (Complex Congenital Stationary Night Blindness)**, which itself can lead to CNV. Additionally, **Nd:YAG laser injury** can cause complications that may contribute to CNV development.  CNV is a significant concern for patients as it can result in vision loss and requires preventative measures. \n\nResearchers are investigating the connection between CNV and other eye diseases like **vitreous degeneration**, and its impact on **brain activity**. The condition's progression can be predicted using specific metrics, and treatment methods are being developed to address this complex issue.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743217658, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 272, "prompt_tokens": 478, "total_tokens": 750, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
