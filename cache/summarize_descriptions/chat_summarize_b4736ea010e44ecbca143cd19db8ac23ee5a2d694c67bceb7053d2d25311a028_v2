It's located within the retina, the tissue responsible for converting light into electrical signals that the brain interprets as images.  Damage to the RPE can be associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of vision loss. The RPE is also studied for its involvement in the migration of Müller cells, another type of retinal cell. Notably, research has shown a decrease in E-cadherin expression within the RPE, which may contribute to AMD progression. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743087975, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 126, "prompt_tokens": 180, "total_tokens": 306, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
