It acts as a signaling molecule and promotes the growth of blood vessels, which is essential for various physiological processes like wound healing and tissue repair.  VEGF is also implicated in tumor growth and can be targeted for treatment of certain blinding diseases. Research on VEGF has been instrumental in understanding **CNV** (choroidal neovascularization) and exploring its potential as a therapeutic target. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743158626, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 107, "prompt_tokens": 301, "total_tokens": 408, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
