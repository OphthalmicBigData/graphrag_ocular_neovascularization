High MVD is often associated with poor prognosis, indicating a higher likelihood of aggressive tumor growth and spread. It can also be used to assess tumor invasion front and as a prognostic factor in certain cancers like OSCC (oral squamous cell carcinoma).  MVD measurement techniques include analyzing the number of blood vessels within a tissue sample.  The MVD is also considered a marker for angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation, which plays a crucial role in tumor growth and development. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743287047, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 123, "prompt_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 314, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
