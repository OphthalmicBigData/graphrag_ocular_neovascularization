They are crucial for forming new blood vessels, playing a vital role in angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels). These cells line the inner surface of blood vessels and contribute to both the structure and function of blood vessels. They are essential for blood flow regulation and tissue repair, making them important subjects of study in various fields like medicine and biology.  Endothelial cells are involved in wound healing, forming the inner lining of blood vessels that is critical for maintaining healthy blood vessel function. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743216859, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 115, "prompt_tokens": 379, "total_tokens": 494, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
