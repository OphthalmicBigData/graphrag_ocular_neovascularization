It can lead to irreversible vision loss, making it a leading cause of severe vision loss in people over 50 worldwide. AMD causes neovascularization, which involves the growth of new blood vessels in the macula. This process can damage the delicate tissue and ultimately result in vision loss. While the exact causes are not fully understood, AMD is associated with certain risk factors like age, genetics, and smoking.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743141730, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 119, "prompt_tokens": 263, "total_tokens": 382, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
