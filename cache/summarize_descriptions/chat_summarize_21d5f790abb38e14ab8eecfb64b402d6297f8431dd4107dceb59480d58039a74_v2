They are derived from the umbilical veins of human fetuses and play a vital role in blood vessel formation (angiogenesis). These cells are essential for studying angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel growth, and have been utilized in numerous studies investigating the effects of Met and Kae on angiogenesis. HUVECs are also used to study the impact of KYNA-PF127 on angiogenesis.  They are a common subject of research due to their relevance to understanding blood vessel development and function. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743303491, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 126, "prompt_tokens": 302, "total_tokens": 428, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
