It is responsible for vision and plays a crucial role in converting light into electrical signals that are sent to the brain.  It's located behind the iris and pupil, where light enters and is focused. The retina contains specialized cells called photoreceptors that detect light and send signals to the brain. Researchers often study the retina using techniques like *in situ* hybridization and flow cytometry. It was also found to be paved with Isolectin GS-IB4 fluorescence staining.  The **retina** is a vital part of the eye, and its function is essential for human vision. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743182507, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 139, "prompt_tokens": 325, "total_tokens": 464, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
