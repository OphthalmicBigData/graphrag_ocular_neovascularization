It acts as a **growth factor** secreted by cells, including those found in the A549 cell line. VEGF-A promotes angiogenesis by stimulating the growth and proliferation of endothelial cells, which are responsible for forming new blood vessel walls. \n\nWhile its role in angiogenesis is well established, research has also shown that VEGF-A can have **immunosuppressive** effects on immune cells.  Furthermore, studies have demonstrated a decrease in VEGF-A expression following exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which suggests a potential link between inflammation and angiogenesis regulation. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743216840, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 155, "prompt_tokens": 255, "total_tokens": 410, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
