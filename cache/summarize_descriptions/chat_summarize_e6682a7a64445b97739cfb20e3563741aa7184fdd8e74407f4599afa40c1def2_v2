It plays a significant role in cell signaling, regulation, and function. AKT functions as a protein kinase, meaning it can add phosphate groups to other proteins, thereby influencing their activity.  It's particularly important for the PI3K/AKT pathway, which regulates cell survival, growth, and metabolism. \n\nThe **AKT** protein is also known by its alternative names: Protein kinase B (PKB) and protein kinase involved in cell signaling and survival. It's a key player in numerous cellular functions, including signal transduction pathways and overall cell function.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743158704, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 131, "prompt_tokens": 213, "total_tokens": 344, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
