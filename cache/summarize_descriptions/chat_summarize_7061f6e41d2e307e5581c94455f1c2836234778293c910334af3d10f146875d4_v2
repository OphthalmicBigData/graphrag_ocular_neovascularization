It is a type of cancer, characterized by the uncontrolled growth of cells.  Tumors can be treated with medicine or immunotherapy.  They are often studied in research to understand their development and treatment options.  Tumor growth can be limited by blocking angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation.  The **tumor** itself is a disease that can be treated by various methods, including medication and immunotherapy.  Tumors are also characterized by active angiogenesis, which involves the creation of new blood vessels to support tumor growth. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743238524, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 123, "prompt_tokens": 289, "total_tokens": 412, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
