It plays a significant role in cell signaling, gene expression regulation, and various physiological functions.  \n\nSpecifically, STAT3 participates in cell proliferation, angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels), and the regulation of molecules like CCL14 and VEGF-A. Its involvement in embryo implantation is also noteworthy.  Furthermore, STAT3 acts as a transcription activator, influencing the expression of numerous genes and proteins involved in cellular processes. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743158584, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 113, "prompt_tokens": 247, "total_tokens": 360, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
