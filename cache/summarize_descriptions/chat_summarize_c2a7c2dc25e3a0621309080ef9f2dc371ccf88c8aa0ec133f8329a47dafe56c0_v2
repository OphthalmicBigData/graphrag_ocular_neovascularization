It can be classified as a disease, and its removal for analysis is known as a biopsy.  Tumors are characterized by their uncontrolled growth and spread, often leading to further development and potentially impacting other tissues. Research on tumors, including their growth mechanisms and potential treatments, has been conducted in mice models. The process of tumor growth involves angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels that supply the growing cells with nutrients and oxygen. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743182700, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 104, "prompt_tokens": 195, "total_tokens": 299, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
