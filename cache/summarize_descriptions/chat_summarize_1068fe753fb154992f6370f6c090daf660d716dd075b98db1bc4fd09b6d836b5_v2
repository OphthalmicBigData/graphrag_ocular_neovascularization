It plays a significant role in regulating cellular processes, including the formation and differentiation of cells.  Furthermore, research has shown that HOXD3 is implicated in the metastasis and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. This gene's involvement in HCC progression highlights its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions aimed at inhibiting tumor growth and spread. Notably, studies have linked HOXD3 to HCC migration, suggesting its role in the movement and invasion of cancer cells within the body.  Additionally, HOXD3 is known to be involved in histone acetylation regulation, further emphasizing its complex influence on cellular processes. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743303676, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 140, "prompt_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 340, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
