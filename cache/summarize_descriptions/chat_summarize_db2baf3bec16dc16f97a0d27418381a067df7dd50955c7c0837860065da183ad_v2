They are a type of extracellular vesicle and can be extracted from cells such as MDA-MB-231 cells. Exosomes are involved in the spread of cancer cells and act as carriers for molecules like miRNAs.  They can also be used for drug delivery due to their ability to carry molecules like miR-502-5p.  Exosomes are a specific type of extracellular vesicle, and they play a role in the tumour microenvironment. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743343538, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 109, "prompt_tokens": 279, "total_tokens": 388, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
