It is best known for its involvement in **angiogenesis**, the formation of new blood vessels, which is essential for tissue repair and development. VEGF also contributes to **retinal neovascularization**, a process where new blood vessels form in the retina, often associated with age-related macular degeneration.  Furthermore, VEGF has been implicated in **axon regeneration** by promoting the growth of new nerve fibers. \n\nIt's important to note that VEGF is a signaling molecule and its effects are mediated through interactions with cell receptors. This protein is also known as **Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor**, and it plays a significant role in **tumor growth**.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743158591, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 155, "prompt_tokens": 227, "total_tokens": 382, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
