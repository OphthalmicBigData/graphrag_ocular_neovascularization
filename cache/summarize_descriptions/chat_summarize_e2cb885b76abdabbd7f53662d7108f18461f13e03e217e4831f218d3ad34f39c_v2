This process, often referred to as **neovascularization**, can lead to various complications, including blindness.  It's considered a leading cause of blindness and is often associated with ischemic retinopathy, a pathological feature of eye diseases that affect blood flow in the retina. RN is also a significant component of blinding disorders, where it contributes to the development of vision loss. The process involves the formation of new blood vessels within the retina, which can be problematic due to their potential for leakage and other complications. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743343480, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 126, "prompt_tokens": 222, "total_tokens": 348, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
