It can manifest as either corneal neovascularization, where new blood vessels form on the cornea, or choroidal neovascularization, which involves abnormal blood vessel growth in the choroid. CNV is a subtype of exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and can be studied for treatment options, including those targeting HRMECs (hyperreflective micro-vessels).  CNV is often diagnosed through optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging and can influence injection intervals in certain conditions. It is also a type of genetic variation that can affect cell viability and proliferation, potentially leading to tissue damage. Research on CNV has been conducted using various methods, including slit lamp microscopy and laser-induced CNV formation in mice models.  The clinical phenotype of CNV in AMD provides valuable insights into the condition's progression and impact on vision. Genetic variation associated with CNV can be suppressed using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743161836, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 222, "prompt_tokens": 363, "total_tokens": 585, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
