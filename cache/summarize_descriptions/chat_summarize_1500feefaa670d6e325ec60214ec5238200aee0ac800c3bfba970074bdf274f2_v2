It serves as an important tool for understanding various biological processes and developing treatments for conditions like retinopathy, angiogenesis, and skeletal organization.  Mice are commonly employed in research due to their genetic similarities to humans and the ability to study disease mechanisms in controlled environments. They are used extensively in animal experiments, with specific applications including studying eye diseases, angiogenesis, and the effects of Con A on angiogenesis. Additionally, mice have been utilized for SVF research and studies focusing on the skeletal organization.  The **MOUSE** model is a valuable resource for researchers seeking to understand human health and develop new therapies. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743088006, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 140, "prompt_tokens": 311, "total_tokens": 451, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
