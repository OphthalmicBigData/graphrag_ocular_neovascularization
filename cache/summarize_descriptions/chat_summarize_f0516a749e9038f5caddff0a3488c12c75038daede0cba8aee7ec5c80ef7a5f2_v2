It plays a role in cell function, and its levels can be downregulated. TNF-α increases HSP70 release in HUVECs (human umbilical vein endothelial cells), and it induces HSP70 release in other cells.  It's also been studied for its effects on LSECs (lymphoid stromal cells).  TNF-α is a cytokine that can affect cell function, and it has been shown to increase the expression of HSP70, a protein involved in cellular stress response. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743343562, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 129, "prompt_tokens": 246, "total_tokens": 375, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
