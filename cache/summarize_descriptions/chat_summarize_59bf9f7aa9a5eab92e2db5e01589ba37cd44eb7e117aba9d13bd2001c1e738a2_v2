It is used to visualize the eye, study the retina, detect Central Nervous System (CNV) abnormalities, and diagnose CNV.  There are various types of OCT, including spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), which provides detailed retinal and choroidal imaging. OCT can also be combined with other techniques like OCT angiography (OCTA) to visualize blood vessels in the eye.  It is used for a variety of purposes, such as ophthalmic examination, studying aneurysmal lesions, analyzing the results of high-frequency photodynamic therapy (hf-PDT), and investigating the correlation between OCT findings and visual acuity outcomes. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743087902, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 159, "prompt_tokens": 352, "total_tokens": 511, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
