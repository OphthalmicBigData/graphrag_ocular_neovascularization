This process results in abnormal cell proliferation, often associated with angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels).  The resulting tumour can grow and spread, leading to various complications. Tumour growth is a complex biological process influenced by factors such as genetic mutations, environmental triggers, and the body's own immune response. It can be inhibited through various means, including antineoplastic agents that target specific pathways involved in cell division or angiogenesis.  Furthermore, tumour growth is closely linked to neovascularization (the formation of new blood vessels) and often leads to hypoxic areas within the tumour due to limited oxygen supply. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743182537, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 149, "prompt_tokens": 273, "total_tokens": 422, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
