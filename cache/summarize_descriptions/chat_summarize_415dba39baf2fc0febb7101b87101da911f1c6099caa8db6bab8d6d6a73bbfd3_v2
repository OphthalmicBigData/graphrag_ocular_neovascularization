It's involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth and signal transduction pathways.  PI3K acts as an enzyme, catalyzing the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol to generate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). This process is essential for regulating a wide range of cellular functions, such as cell survival, proliferation, migration, and metabolism.  Furthermore, PI3K is implicated in vascular malformations due to its role in angiogenesis. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743158645, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 130, "prompt_tokens": 221, "total_tokens": 351, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
