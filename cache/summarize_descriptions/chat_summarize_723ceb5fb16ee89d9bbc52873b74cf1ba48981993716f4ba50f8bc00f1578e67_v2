They are involved in various physiological processes, including blood vessel formation, maintenance, wound healing, and tumor growth.  These cells form the innermost layer of blood vessels and contribute to the circulatory system. Endothelial cells are also studied for hornerin expression and are used in research on angiogenesis, a process crucial for blood vessel development. \n\nEndothelial cells can be found in both healthy blood vessels and within the tumor microenvironment, where they interact with other cell types and influence tumor growth.  They are particularly important in the context of diabetes, as damaged endothelial cells contribute to vascular complications associated with the disease. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743343494, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 151, "prompt_tokens": 368, "total_tokens": 519, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
