Blood flow is essential for delivering oxygen to tissues and organs, including the ischemic limb (a limb with reduced blood supply). Increased blood flow in wound areas signifies a heightened circulatory response to injury or trauma. Notably, blood flow plays a vital role in delivering oxygen to the heart itself, ensuring its proper function.
