It acts as a receptor tyrosine kinase, meaning it receives signals from other molecules and triggers cellular responses.  \n\nSpecifically, VEGFR2 plays a vital role in angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels. This protein is involved in both normal physiological processes like vascular remodeling and pathological conditions such as tumor growth. \n\nVEGFR2 is targeted by anti-cancer agents due to its involvement in tumor development. It's also implicated in vessel proliferation within endothelial cells, making it a key target for research into various diseases.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743238567, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 143, "prompt_tokens": 292, "total_tokens": 435, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
