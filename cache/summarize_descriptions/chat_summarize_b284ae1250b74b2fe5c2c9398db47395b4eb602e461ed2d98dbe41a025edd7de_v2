It can occur in various tissues and organs, including the retina, cornea, skin, and central nervous system. \n\n**Applications:**\n\n* **Retinal Health:** Neovascularization plays a role in preventing the progression of retinal diseases like retinopathy and outer retinal atrophy.  \n* **Diabetic Complications:** It is also involved in improving the diabetic microenvironment by reducing complications associated with diabetes.\n* **Central Nervous System:** Active neovascularization can be observed in the central nervous system, impacting its function. \n* **Eye Surgery:** Neovascularization is a factor in the formation of new blood vessels after cataract surgery, particularly in the iris.  \n* **Wound Healing:**  Neovascularization is involved in increased blood vessel growth at wound sites, contributing to tissue repair and regeneration.\n\n**Methods & Treatments:**\n\n* **PRP Treatment:** Neovascularization can be stimulated by platelet-rich plasma (PRP) treatment, leading to increased blood vessel formation. \n\n\n**Contradictions:** While some descriptions mention neovascularization in the central nervous system, others focus on its role in the retina and cornea.  It's important to note that neovascularization is a complex process with diverse applications across different tissues. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743158623, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 274, "prompt_tokens": 291, "total_tokens": 565, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
