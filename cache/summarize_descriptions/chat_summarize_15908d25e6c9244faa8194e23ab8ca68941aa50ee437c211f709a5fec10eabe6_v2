This process can lead to vision loss and is often associated with neovascular fundus diseases. CNV can occur independently or as part of other conditions like melanocytoma, and it's been investigated in mouse models.  It's considered a medical condition that causes visual impairment. \n\nCNV measurements are being compared between swept-source and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography angiography (SS-OCTA and SD-OCTA) to study its role in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). CNV is also a process where new blood vessels form in the eye, potentially leading to vision loss. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743345230, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 165, "prompt_tokens": 398, "total_tokens": 563, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
