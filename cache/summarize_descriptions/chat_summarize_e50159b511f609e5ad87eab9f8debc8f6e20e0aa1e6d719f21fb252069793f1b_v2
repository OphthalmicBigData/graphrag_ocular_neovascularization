This condition can be caused by angiogenesis, a process where new blood vessels form to support tumor growth.  Treatment options for cancer include therapy and antiangiogenic phytochemicals. Cancer cells can negatively impact immune cell function, highlighting the need for effective treatment strategies.  Cancer is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, necessitating prompt intervention. Various types of cancer are treatable with Aurora kinase inhibitors and angiogenesis inhibitors. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743182527, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 103, "prompt_tokens": 275, "total_tokens": 378, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
