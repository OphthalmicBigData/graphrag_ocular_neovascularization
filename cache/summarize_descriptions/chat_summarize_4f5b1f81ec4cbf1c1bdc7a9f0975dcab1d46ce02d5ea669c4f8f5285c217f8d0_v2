They are often employed in tumor studies due to their susceptibility to developing tumors and their genetic makeup that allows researchers to study the effects of various treatments on cancer growth.  Nude mice are also frequently utilized in xenograft experiments, where they are implanted with human tumor cells to observe how these cells grow and interact with the host's immune system. Additionally, nude mice have been used in studies involving subcutaneous matrix rubber suppositories, a model for studying drug delivery and absorption. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743328223, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 119, "prompt_tokens": 174, "total_tokens": 293, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
