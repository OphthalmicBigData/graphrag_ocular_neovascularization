It can develop in patients with proliferative MacTel 2 and was studied in various research projects. MNV is characterized as a specific type of neovascularization in the eye, often involving the development of new blood vessels within the macula.  It's important to note that MNV can be caused by a virus, leading to a disease affecting vision. The condition is also associated with measurement techniques like multimodal imaging data used for studying Ranibizumab. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743141735, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 120, "prompt_tokens": 240, "total_tokens": 360, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
