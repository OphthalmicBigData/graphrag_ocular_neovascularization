It can be caused by other conditions like CSCR (Congenital Stickler Syndrome) and is often categorized as Stage 1 type 3 MNV.  MNV is a complex condition studied for its impact on the retina and how it relates to changes in the eye's structure. Researchers use techniques like OCT-A to detect this condition, and multidimensional scaling analysis helps understand the similarities between different subtypes of MNV based on their cytokine profiles. \n\n\n**Note:** The term \"Macular Nerve Vision\" is often used interchangeably with MNV, but it specifically refers to a type of vision loss related to the macula (the central part of the retina).  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743089684, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 178, "prompt_tokens": 355, "total_tokens": 533, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
