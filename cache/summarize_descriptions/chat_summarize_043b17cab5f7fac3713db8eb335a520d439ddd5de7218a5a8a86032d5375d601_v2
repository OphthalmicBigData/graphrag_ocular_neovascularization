It's also known as **Protein kinase B (PKB)** and is involved in both **cell signaling** and **growth**.  AKT is a serine/threonine kinase, meaning it phosphorylates other proteins to regulate their activity. This action influences numerous cellular functions, including cell proliferation, survival, migration, and angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels). \n\nThe AKT protein is also associated with research in the field of **cell signaling** and has been studied extensively for its role in various diseases.  It's important to note that **AKT** can be found in both **companies** like **AKT** involved in research, as well as **organizations** dedicated to studying the **Akt pathway**. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743182540, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 170, "prompt_tokens": 265, "total_tokens": 435, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
