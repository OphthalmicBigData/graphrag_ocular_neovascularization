It is a **growth factor** involved in **angiogenesis**, the formation of new blood vessels, and is essential for **cell growth and development**.  \n\nVEGFA is also implicated in **tumor growth** and **cancer angiogenesis**. It can be used to inhibit the vascularization of cartilage, making it a potential target for treating diseases like **Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)**. \n\nThe **VEGFA axis** is being investigated as a target for treatment of **diabetic foot ulcers (DFU)**.  It is also involved in regulating the **RTK activation pathway**, and its network may be used to predict patient outcomes.  \n\nFurthermore, VEGFA is a protein that can be found in concentrated cell populations. \n\n\n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743182522, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 185, "prompt_tokens": 369, "total_tokens": 554, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
