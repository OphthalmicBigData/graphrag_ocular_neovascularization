These cells are derived from human umbilical veins and play a fundamental role in blood vessel formation. They are considered a standard model for assessing angiogenic potential, meaning their ability to form new blood vessels. HUVECs are also used in research on bone regeneration and the effects of QDZ (a specific compound) on angiogenesis.  They are commonly employed as a tool for studying cell proliferation and migration. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743343495, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 111, "prompt_tokens": 327, "total_tokens": 438, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
