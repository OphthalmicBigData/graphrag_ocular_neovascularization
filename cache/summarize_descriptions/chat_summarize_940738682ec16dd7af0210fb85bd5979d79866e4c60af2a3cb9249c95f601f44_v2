It involves separating proteins based on their size using gel electrophoresis, followed by transferring them to a membrane where they are detected using antibodies specific to the target protein. This method allows for the detection of specific proteins and provides insights into their abundance and function. Western blotting analysis can be used to evaluate the effect of various factors, such as environmental stresses like EMS (ethyl methanesulfonate), on Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743255772, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 104, "prompt_tokens": 188, "total_tokens": 292, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
