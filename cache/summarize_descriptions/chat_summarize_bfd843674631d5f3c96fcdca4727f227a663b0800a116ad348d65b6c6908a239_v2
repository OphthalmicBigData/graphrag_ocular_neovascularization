It can be caused by various factors, including genetic abnormalities and tissue damage.  CNV is often studied in research as it can lead to blindness, particularly among the elderly population in developed countries. The study of CNV involves examining lesions in the eye, such as those found in the retina or cornea, to measure and verify the efficacy of treatments. \n\n**Note:** While some descriptions mention \"Cnv\" as a statistically significant reduction in the length and diameter of CNV, it's important to remember that this is a specific aspect of the condition and not the primary definition.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743238547, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 145, "prompt_tokens": 346, "total_tokens": 491, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
