This process can lead to leakage of fluid in the eye, causing vision loss. CNV is a hallmark feature of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and can be studied in mouse models.  It is also a late recurrence of CNV in elderly patients, making it a medical condition that needs to be predicted for treatment. \n\nCNV is often associated with wet AMD, a more severe form of AMD characterized by abnormal blood vessel formation in the choroid. While CNV can cause vision loss in both children and the elderly, it is particularly prevalent in the latter group.  The process of new blood vessel formation in the choroid (CNV) is being studied as part of research into age-related macular degeneration. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743089687, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 187, "prompt_tokens": 365, "total_tokens": 552, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
