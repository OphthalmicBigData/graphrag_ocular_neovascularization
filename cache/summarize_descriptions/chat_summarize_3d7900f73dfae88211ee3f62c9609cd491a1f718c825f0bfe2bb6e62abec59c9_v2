This approach involves studying cells in a controlled environment, such as cell culture or tube formation studies, to understand various biological processes like angiogenesis.  It allows for the testing of materials and drugs in a precise setting, enabling researchers to study their effects on cells in a more controlled manner than in vivo (within living organisms). **IN VITRO** methods are often used to examine the effects of treatments or inhibitors on cells in a controlled environment, such as when studying TAK1 inhibition's impact on angiogenesis.
