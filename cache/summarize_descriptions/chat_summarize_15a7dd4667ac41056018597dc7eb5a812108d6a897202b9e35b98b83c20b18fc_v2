They are commonly employed in various studies to investigate cell viability, inflammation, and the effects of treatments on these processes. These cells are often used in vitro, meaning they are studied outside of a living organism. HUVECs are a type of endothelial cell, which play a crucial role in blood vessel formation and function. They are specifically known for their involvement in angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel growth.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743158636, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 112, "prompt_tokens": 309, "total_tokens": 421, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
