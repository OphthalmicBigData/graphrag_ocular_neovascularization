They play crucial roles in various physiological processes, including blood vessel formation and maintenance, angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels), and repair.  These cells line the inner surface of blood vessels, forming the inner lining. Endothelial cells are essential for regulating blood flow, nutrient exchange, and waste removal within tissues. \n\nThey are also studied extensively in various research contexts, including:\n* **Angiogenesis:** Understanding how endothelial cells contribute to new blood vessel formation is crucial for treating diseases like cancer and cardiovascular disorders.\n* **Tumor Microenvironment:** Endothelial cells play a role in tumor growth and metastasis, making them important targets for cancer therapies. \n* **Stem Cell Research:**  Endothelial cells are often used as models for studying stem cell differentiation and migration.\n* **Tissue Repair:** Endothelial cells contribute to wound healing and tissue repair by forming new blood vessels at the site of injury.\n\nSpecific types of endothelial cells, such as primary human endothelial cells, are used in various research experiments and studies.  Endothelial cells have been studied for their response to RA FLS derived EVs (extracellular vesicles) and their role in the context of SCI (spinal cord injuries). \n\n\n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743141722, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 258, "prompt_tokens": 396, "total_tokens": 654, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
