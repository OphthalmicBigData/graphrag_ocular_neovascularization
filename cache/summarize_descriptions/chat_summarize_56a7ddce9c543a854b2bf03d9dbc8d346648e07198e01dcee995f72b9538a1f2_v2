This condition can lead to severe vision loss and is often studied in animal models.  It involves the formation of new blood vessels in the eye's choroid, which can be caused by various factors like genetic mutations or injury. CNV can also be a clinical finding, indicating the presence of abnormal blood vessel growth. \n\nCNV has been investigated as a potential target for treatment and is often studied using techniques such as laser photocoagulation and conbercept injection.  It's important to note that CNV can also refer to the recurrence of tumors in the brain or spinal cord, known as **Central Nervous System (CNS) involvement**. \n\nResearch on CNV has been conducted in various contexts, including clinical trials for treatment and animal models like mice. The study of CNV often involves analyzing lesions using techniques like laser confocal microscopy and investigating genetic changes observed in the brain.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743238546, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 209, "prompt_tokens": 526, "total_tokens": 735, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
