It is classified as both a gene and a pro-angiogenic factor, meaning it stimulates the formation of new blood vessels.  VEGF is involved in angiogenesis, the process of creating new blood vessels, and is essential for cell growth and development. \n\nIt also contributes to inflammation and wound healing. VEGF's role in tumor growth and angiogenesis has led to its investigation as a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment. Notably, it is studied for its involvement in the mechanism of PLGC (Phospholipid-Glycolipid Complex) therapy.  Furthermore, VEGF is recognized as a protein that promotes blood vessel formation and plays a significant role in cell growth and development. \n\n\n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743328194, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 161, "prompt_tokens": 343, "total_tokens": 504, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
