It involves separating proteins based on their size using gel electrophoresis, followed by transferring the separated proteins to a membrane.  The membrane then undergoes an incubation with antibodies that specifically bind to the target protein of interest. This binding event is detected through various methods like chemiluminescence or colorimetric assays, allowing for the visualization and quantification of the target protein. Western blotting is widely used in research to analyze protein expression levels and identify specific proteins within a sample. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743238597, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 108, "prompt_tokens": 177, "total_tokens": 285, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
