It can occur in the **eye**, contributing to vision loss in diseases like **ocular neovascularization** which causes irreversible blindness. In the context of **cancer treatment**, neovascularization is a key target as it can contribute to tumor growth and spread. It also plays a role in **corneal allograft rejection**, where new blood vessels form, leading to inflammation and rejection.  Neovascularization can be observed in the **posterior pole** of the eye and is associated with **new blood vessel formation** in the retina. This process can also contribute to the spread of **intracranial calcifications (ICC)**. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743217655, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 151, "prompt_tokens": 284, "total_tokens": 435, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
