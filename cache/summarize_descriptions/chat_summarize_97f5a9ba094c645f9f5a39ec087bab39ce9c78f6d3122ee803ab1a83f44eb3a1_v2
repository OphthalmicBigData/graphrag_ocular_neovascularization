This environment plays a crucial role in influencing tumor growth, progression, and response to chemotherapy.  It's characterized by interactions between tumor cells, immune cells, and other molecules like extracellular vesicles (EVs). The TME is also influenced by angiogenesis, which refers to the formation of new blood vessels within the tumor.  The TME can be described as the area surrounding a tumor where cells interact and influence each other, including their response to chemotherapy. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743182494, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 119, "prompt_tokens": 299, "total_tokens": 418, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
