It can cause vision loss and is often studied as a type of **Macular Neuropathy**.  MNV is characterized by changes in the retina, and its severity can be categorized into stages, with Stage 1 Type 3 MNV being one specific example. The condition can also be detected using Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCT-A).  \n\nWhile MNV itself is a medical condition, it's often referred to as **Macular Nerve Vision** or **Multifocal Neuroretinopathy**, which are terms that highlight its impact on the central part of the retina. \n \nMNV can be secondary to another condition called Congenital Stationary Night Blindness (CSCR).  It is also a condition studied through multidimensional scaling analysis, which helps researchers understand the similarities and differences between various subtypes based on their cytokine profiles.\n\n\n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743087893, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 209, "prompt_tokens": 377, "total_tokens": 586, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
