This process plays a crucial role in tumor growth, progression, and metastasis.  It is often described as the \"process of new blood vessel formation in tumors\". \n\n\n**Key points:**\n\n* **Definition:** Tumor angiogenesis involves the creation of new blood vessels within a tumor environment.\n* **Purpose:** This process provides the tumor with essential nutrients and oxygen for growth and expansion, ultimately contributing to metastasis. \n* **Relevance:**  Understanding tumor angiogenesis is crucial for developing effective cancer treatments targeting this process.\n\n\n**Related Concepts:**\n\n* Tumor growth and metastasis are closely linked to angiogenesis. \n* The descriptions highlight the importance of blood vessel formation in tumors. \n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other information or specific aspects you'd like me to focus on! \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743345243, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 185, "prompt_tokens": 307, "total_tokens": 492, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
