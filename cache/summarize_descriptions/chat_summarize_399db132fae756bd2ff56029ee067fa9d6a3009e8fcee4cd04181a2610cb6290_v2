Derived from human umbilical veins, these cells play a fundamental role in blood vessel formation and function. They are considered a standard model for assessing angiogenic potential, meaning their ability to promote the growth of new blood vessels. HUVECs are also used in research on bone regeneration and the effects of QDZ (a specific compound) on angiogenesis.  They are essential for understanding how cells interact during tissue repair and development. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743345214, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 115, "prompt_tokens": 319, "total_tokens": 434, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
