It is particularly useful for studying retinal neovascularization, disease progression, and macular neovascularization.  OCTA uses 3D imaging to create detailed images of the retina, allowing researchers to examine the structure and function of blood vessels in the eye. This technique has applications in ophthalmology, enabling clinicians to monitor disease progression and diagnose various eye conditions. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743287001, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 100, "prompt_tokens": 231, "total_tokens": 331, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
