This field of study investigates various aspects of wound healing, including cell migration, invasion, and the use of functional hydrogels for accelerated healing.  It is a crucial process that occurs after injury, aiming to restore functionality and minimize disfiguring scars. Researchers have explored this process in both mice models and human studies, particularly focusing on individuals with diabetes who experience altered wound healing. The study aims to develop innovative methods like using exosomes to enhance wound healing. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743345217, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 119, "prompt_tokens": 349, "total_tokens": 468, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
