This protein is a key player in **angiogenesis**, the process of forming new blood vessels. VEGFA is involved in vascular development and plays a crucial role in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions, including **ACL ruptures**. Research has linked VEGFA to ACL rupture risk and its development.  It's also been studied in relation to circAFAP1, highlighting its importance in various biological contexts. \n\n**VEGFA** is a well-established growth factor that promotes angiogenesis and blood vessel formation.
