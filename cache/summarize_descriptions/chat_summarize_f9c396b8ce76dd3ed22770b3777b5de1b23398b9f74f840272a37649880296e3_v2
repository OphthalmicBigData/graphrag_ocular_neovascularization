It acts as a signaling molecule that promotes blood vessel formation by stimulating the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells.  **VEGF** plays a crucial role in tumor angiogenesis, where it contributes to the growth and spread of tumors by promoting new blood vessel formation. The **VEGF signaling axis** regulates this process, ensuring proper blood supply for tissue development and repair. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743158754, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 112, "prompt_tokens": 203, "total_tokens": 315, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
