It serves as a model for studying lung metastasis in mouse models.  Specifically, the **lung** is the location where cancer cells can spread to, known as metastasis. Additionally, the **lung** plays a role in angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels) and fibrosis (scarring), processes that are often associated with various diseases. Finally, the **lung** is also an organ where D cells prefer to grow. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743255698, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 111, "prompt_tokens": 181, "total_tokens": 292, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
