It plays a significant role in the antioxidant response, promoting tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and regulating proangiogenic mediators, antioxidant, and detoxification enzymes.  NRF2 also regulates cellular responses to oxidative stress and various types of stress, contributing to the study's understanding of mechanisms involved in cellular stress response and damage. This protein is vital for vascular regeneration as well. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743328272, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 105, "prompt_tokens": 241, "total_tokens": 346, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
