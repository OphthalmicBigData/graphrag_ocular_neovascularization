It refers to the phenomenon where cancer cells develop the ability to resist the effects of targeted therapies, such as those designed to inhibit specific pathways involved in tumor growth. This resistance can be attributed to several factors, including the development of mutations that alter drug targets or mechanisms of action, leading to reduced drug efficacy. Additionally, anti-angiogenic therapy, which aims to block blood vessel formation and starve tumors of nutrients, often faces limitations due to drug resistance.  Ultimately, cancer cells' ability to develop resistance to treatment is a complex process that hinders the effectiveness of therapies and necessitates further research into overcoming this challenge. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743328226, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 142, "prompt_tokens": 176, "total_tokens": 318, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
