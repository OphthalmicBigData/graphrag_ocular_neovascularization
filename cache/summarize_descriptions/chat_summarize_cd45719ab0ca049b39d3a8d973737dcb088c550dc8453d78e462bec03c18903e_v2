It plays a crucial role in cell growth and development, but its activity can also contribute to tumor growth.  It's a target for the drug ramucirumab, which inhibits VEGFR2 signaling. This protein is part of the VEGFR2/AKT signaling pathway and is being studied for its effects on angiogenesis.  VEGFR2 is involved in both normal physiological processes like angiogenesis and pathological conditions such as tumor growth. It can be targeted to inhibit angiogenesis and anti-angiogenesis therapies are being developed based on this understanding. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743303499, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 132, "prompt_tokens": 267, "total_tokens": 399, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
