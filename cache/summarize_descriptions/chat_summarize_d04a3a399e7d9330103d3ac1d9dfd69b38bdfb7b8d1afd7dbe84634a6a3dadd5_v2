It plays a crucial role in the growth and survival of endothelial cells, which are essential for forming new blood vessels.  \n\nVEGFA has been extensively studied for its involvement in various physiological processes, including:\n\n* **Angiogenesis:** VEGFA promotes the formation of new blood vessels by stimulating endothelial cell proliferation and migration.\n* **ACL rupture risk:** Research suggests that VEGFA may contribute to the development of ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament) rupture risk. \n* **HCC cells expressing SHBs:**  VEGFA levels have been found to be enhanced in HCC (Hepatocellular Carcinoma) cells expressing SHBs (Specific Hepatic Proteins).\n\nFurthermore, VEGFA has been linked to blood vessel formation and is a key player in the development of various vascular-related conditions. \n\n\n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743087918, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 206, "prompt_tokens": 319, "total_tokens": 525, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
