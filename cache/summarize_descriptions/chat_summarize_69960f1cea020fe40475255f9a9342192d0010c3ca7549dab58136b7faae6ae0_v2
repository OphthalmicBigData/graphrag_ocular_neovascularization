This field of study utilizes functional hydrogels for wound healing.  It involves assessing cell migration and invasion using methods like those used to measure cell migration.  Researchers also investigate the process in mice models and aim to develop new methods for wound healing, such as utilizing exosomes.  **WOUND HEALING** is a crucial process that occurs after injury and aims to restore functionality and minimize disfiguring scars. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743343501, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 110, "prompt_tokens": 385, "total_tokens": 495, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
