It serves as a primary site for studying certain genetic conditions like Congenital Nicotine-Induced Renal Disease (CNRD) in mice, where researchers have investigated changes in chromosome number (CNV).  The **kidney** is also the origin of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), a type of kidney cancer. In addition, it plays a role in research on fibrosis, specifically in mouse models where the effects of inhibiting angiogenesis are studied. Finally, the **kidney** is affected by angiogenesis inhibition, which disrupts blood vessel formation and can impact its function. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743088040, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 145, "prompt_tokens": 179, "total_tokens": 324, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
