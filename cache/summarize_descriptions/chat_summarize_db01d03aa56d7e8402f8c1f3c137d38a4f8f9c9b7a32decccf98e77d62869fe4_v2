They are a widely used cell line in research, particularly for studying angiogenesis and vascular biology.  These cells are crucial for understanding the processes involved in blood vessel formation and function. HUVECs are also employed to study tumor growth and the Nrf2 pathway. Researchers utilize these cells to explore various biological functions, including angiogenesis, vascular biology, and the role of Nrf2 in cellular responses. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743328168, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 105, "prompt_tokens": 353, "total_tokens": 458, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
