It involves the growth of new blood vessels within the choroid, a layer of tissue behind the retina. This process can lead to vision loss due to fluid build-up in the eye or other complications. CNV is often associated with various eye diseases and can be a rare complication of MEWDS (Malignant Endothelial Weal Disease).  It's considered a pathological feature that causes visual impairment, similar to how it mimics human CNV in mice. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743141729, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 116, "prompt_tokens": 253, "total_tokens": 369, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
