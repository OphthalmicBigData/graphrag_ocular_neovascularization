It is a receptor tyrosine kinase that binds to Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and promotes angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels.  VEGFR2 is also involved in fibrosis, where it contributes to the development of scar tissue. \n\nThe **VEGFR2** gene is targeted by lentiviral vectors for silencing experiments, highlighting its importance in research. It is a pro-angiogenic receptor, meaning it promotes angiogenesis and plays a role in blood vessel growth.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743345236, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 123, "prompt_tokens": 261, "total_tokens": 384, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
