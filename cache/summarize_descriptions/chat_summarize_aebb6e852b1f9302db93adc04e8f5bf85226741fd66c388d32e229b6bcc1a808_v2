It is a hallmark of late-stage diabetic retinopathy and occurs in response to ischemia, meaning insufficient blood flow.  It can also occur as a result of other conditions like Moyamoya disease, where it's treated surgically.  Neovascularization provides tumors with nutrients and oxygen for growth. In the context of eye health, neovascularization is often observed in diabetic retinopathy, leading to abnormal blood vessel formation that can damage the retina.  Studies have documented neovascularization as a result of PDR (diabetic proliferative retinopathy). The process of new blood vessel formation is also referred to as **neovascularization**. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743238553, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 148, "prompt_tokens": 257, "total_tokens": 405, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
