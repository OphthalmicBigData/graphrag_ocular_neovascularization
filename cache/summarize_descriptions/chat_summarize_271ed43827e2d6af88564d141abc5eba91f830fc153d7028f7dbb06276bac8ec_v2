Derived from human umbilical cords, these cells are crucial for studying blood vessel function, angiogenesis, and wound healing.  They play a vital role in blood vessel formation and are used as a cellular model to study various biological processes like hypoxia treatment and cell viability. HUVECs are commonly employed in co-culture experiments with other cell types such as HT-ASC-EVs and ASC-EVs, allowing for the investigation of their interactions and effects on angiogenesis.  Their use in biomedical research stems from their ability to mimic the function of endothelial cells found in blood vessels, making them a valuable tool for understanding vascular development and disease. \\n\\nHUVECs are particularly important for studying blood vessel function, angiogenesis, and wound healing.
