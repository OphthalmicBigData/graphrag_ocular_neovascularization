Tumors are characterized by their uncontrolled growth and can be influenced by factors like hypoxia (lack of oxygen) and angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels). They are also often studied in relation to the **tumor microenvironment**, which encompasses the surrounding cells and molecules that influence tumor development and progression. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743255665, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 104, "prompt_tokens": 259, "total_tokens": 363, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
