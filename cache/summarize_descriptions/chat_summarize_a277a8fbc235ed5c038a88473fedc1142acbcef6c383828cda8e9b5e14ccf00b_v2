It's important to note that MNV can be **complicating factor** in the left eye, and its impact on vision can vary depending on individual cases.  \\n\", \"The **MNV** (Macular Neurovascular Disease) is a medical condition that affects vision, specifically related to the retina. It develops in patients with proliferative MacTel 2 and is characterized by treatment-naïve neovascularization, meaning new blood vessels develop without any signs of exudation.  This condition is often associated with pachychoroid features, which are specific structural characteristics linked to its development and progression. The **MNV** entity itself is a type of virus that causes vision-impairing disease. Researchers in the field of ophthalmology, known as the **MNV** group, have been studying eye diseases and conducted research on patients who were infected with this specific virus.  The **MNV** condition can be caused by a virus, leading to vision-impairing disease. It is also associated with measurement techniques like multimodal imaging data used for studying Ranibizumab. \\n\\n\\n\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gemma2:2b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_summarize_a277a8fbc235ed5c038a88473fedc1142acbcef6c383828cda8e9b5e14ccf00b_v2"}
