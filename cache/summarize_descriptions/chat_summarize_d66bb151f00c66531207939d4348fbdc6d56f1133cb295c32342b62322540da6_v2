It's classified as a protein, and it plays a role in various cellular processes, including angiogenesis regulation.  Interestingly, JAG1 has been linked to poor prognosis in TNBC patients. This protein is also known to be upregulated by Bmp9 signaling. Notably, JAG1 exhibits high mutation rates, which contribute to its cancer-promoting function.  Furthermore, JAG1 is involved in cell signaling pathways and acts as a key component of the cellular environment. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743255634, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 117, "prompt_tokens": 206, "total_tokens": 323, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
