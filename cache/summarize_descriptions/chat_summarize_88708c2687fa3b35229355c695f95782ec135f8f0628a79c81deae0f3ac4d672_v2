It is an imaging method that provides precise assessment of the retina, allowing for detailed analysis of its structure and function. OCT scans are particularly useful in diagnosing exudative AMD and DLS, as well as measuring the size of the non-exudative MNV (Macular Nerve Volume).  The technique involves capturing images using light waves to create cross-sectional views of the eye's retina. These images can be used for diagnosis and monitoring of various eye conditions, including those related to the macula. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743287055, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 128, "prompt_tokens": 260, "total_tokens": 388, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
