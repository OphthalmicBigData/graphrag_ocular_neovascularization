Derived from cells, exosomes can be extracted and characterized from various sources, including gastric cancer (GC). These small vesicles are found in bodily fluids and can carry information between cells. The study of exosomes as a biological entity is crucial for understanding their potential use in medical treatments. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743182531, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 101, "prompt_tokens": 276, "total_tokens": 377, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
