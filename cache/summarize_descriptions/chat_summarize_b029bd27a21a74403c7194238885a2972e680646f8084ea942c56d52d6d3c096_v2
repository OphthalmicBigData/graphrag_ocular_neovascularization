They are known to be recruited to sites of injury, where they can contribute to tissue repair and regeneration. In research studies, MSCs have been injected into the hindlimbs of rats to investigate their ability to promote angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels) and vascular density. These stem cells possess the unique ability to differentiate into various cell types, making them a promising subject for research on proliferation and treatment with EPAG.  MSCs are also being investigated as a potential tool for tissue repair due to their capacity to contribute to the formation of new tissues and organs. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743328762, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 146, "prompt_tokens": 225, "total_tokens": 371, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
