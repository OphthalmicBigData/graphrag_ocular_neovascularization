It's responsible for processing light and converting it into electrical signals that are sent to the brain for interpretation.  Located at the back of the eye, the retina contains specialized cells called photoreceptors that detect light and transmit this information to the optic nerve. The retina is also affected by various diseases and conditions, including ischemia-induced pathological neovascularization, where new abnormal blood vessels form. It can be affected by oxygen-induced retinopathy as well.  The retina is essential for vision and its function is vital for our ability to see. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743217656, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 133, "prompt_tokens": 331, "total_tokens": 464, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
