Specifically, EVs derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (HUCMSCs) have shown potential in therapeutic applications.  Furthermore, the effects of hypoxia on extracellular vesicles are being investigated, highlighting their dynamic nature and potential for diverse functions. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743328207, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 100, "prompt_tokens": 210, "total_tokens": 310, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
