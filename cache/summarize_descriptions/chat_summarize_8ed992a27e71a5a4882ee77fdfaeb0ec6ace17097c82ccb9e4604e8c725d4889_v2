Derived from newborns, these cells are used in various research areas, including studying the effects of OSA-DA on wound healing, testing compounds like RATEA16, vascular tube formation, angiogenesis research, and observing the effect of Mat on RA. They are also utilized in tissue engineering studies. \\n\\nHUVECs are a type of human cell derived from the human umbilical vein.  They are commonly used in research, particularly in studies of angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels. HUVECs are also studied in the context of VH-EVs and their role in forming blood vessels.
