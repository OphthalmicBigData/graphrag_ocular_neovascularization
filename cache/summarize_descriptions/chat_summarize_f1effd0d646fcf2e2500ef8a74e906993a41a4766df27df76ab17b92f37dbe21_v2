It helps researchers understand the biological functions of genes by comparing the expression levels of different groups of genes in a sample to a reference set of known genes and their associated functions. GSEA can be used to identify statistically significant changes in gene expression that are related to specific biological processes or pathways, such as cell signaling, metabolism, or immune response.  It is also a method for analyzing gene expression and biological functions. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743240869, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 107, "prompt_tokens": 170, "total_tokens": 277, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
