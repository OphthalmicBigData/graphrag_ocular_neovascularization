This condition can significantly impair vision and potentially lead to blindness, as it increases the risk of rejection after keratoplasty.  It arises due to an imbalance between pro-angiogenic (promoting vessel growth) and anti-angiogenic (suppressing vessel growth) factors. The study of corneal neovascularization is a crucial area of research, with investigations focusing on its mechanisms and potential treatments. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743343486, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 104, "prompt_tokens": 277, "total_tokens": 381, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
