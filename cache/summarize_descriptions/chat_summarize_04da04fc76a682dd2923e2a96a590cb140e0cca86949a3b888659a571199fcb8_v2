It serves as a biological model for studying various aspects of development, including tumor growth and angiogenesis. Researchers utilize the CAM for investigating these processes due to its unique properties, such as its ability to support tumor formation and its responsiveness to angiogenic stimuli. The CAM is also commonly employed in assays like the chorioallantoic membrane assay, which allows researchers to study the effects of various substances on angiogenesis. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743087935, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 105, "prompt_tokens": 199, "total_tokens": 304, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
