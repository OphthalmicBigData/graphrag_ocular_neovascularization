It is also employed for identifying regulatory mechanisms of related genes and studying various biological processes such as macrophage function and metastatic tumor development.  This method involves detecting proteins in cells using specific antibodies and visualizing them on an electrophoretic gel. The Western blot technique can be used to study the effect of different stimuli, like drugs or disease states, on protein expression levels within cells. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743159217, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 101, "prompt_tokens": 236, "total_tokens": 337, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
