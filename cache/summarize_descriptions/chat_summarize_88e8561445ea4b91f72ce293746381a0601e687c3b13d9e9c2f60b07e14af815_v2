This dynamic space, often described as the area around a tumor, plays a crucial role in angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels), immune cell interactions with both tumor cells and the tumor itself, and cellular communication between different types of cells within the tumor.  The TME is characterized by the presence of blood vessels, immune cells, and other cells that interact and influence each other, ultimately shaping the tumor's growth and progression. The TME plays a significant role in influencing tumor growth, progression, and response to treatment.
