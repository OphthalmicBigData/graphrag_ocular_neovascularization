Studies indicate that CS can stimulate the activity of **ADSCs**, leading to enhanced migration, improved angiogenic capacity, and increased wound healing. Specifically, CS has been shown to promote the migration of **ADSCs** and reduce oxidative stress in these cells. Additionally, CS application has demonstrated positive effects on wound healing in a mouse model of full-thickness skin defects.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743239078, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 106, "prompt_tokens": 202, "total_tokens": 308, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
