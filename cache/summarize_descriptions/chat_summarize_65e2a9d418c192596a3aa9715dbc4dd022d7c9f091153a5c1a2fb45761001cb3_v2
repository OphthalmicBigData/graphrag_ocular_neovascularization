They are emerging as critical regulators of GBM pathogenesis, and their involvement in cancer progression is significant. MicroRNAs are involved in tumor angiogenesis, meaning they contribute to the formation of new blood vessels in tumors. They act by binding to messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules, which carry genetic instructions from DNA to ribosomes for protein synthesis. This interaction can either silence or enhance gene expression, ultimately influencing cellular processes and potentially contributing to cancer development. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743287137, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 123, "prompt_tokens": 216, "total_tokens": 339, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
