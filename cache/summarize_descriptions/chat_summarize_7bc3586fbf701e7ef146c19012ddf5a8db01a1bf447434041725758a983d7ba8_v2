It is a significant contributor to blindness, often serving as a heavy attribute in blinding diseases. CNV can be caused by various factors, including alkali burns, and its underlying mechanisms are being studied through research focusing on molecules involved in the process. This condition is considered a vision-threatening disease, with corneal neovascularization being the second major cause of blindness globally. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743287132, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 110, "prompt_tokens": 258, "total_tokens": 368, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
