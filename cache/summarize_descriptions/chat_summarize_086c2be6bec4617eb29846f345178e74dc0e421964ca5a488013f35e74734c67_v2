It involves the controlled dismantling and removal of cells, which can be analyzed to assess cell death. This process was investigated using various assays to detect the cell death process observed in the study. The study focused on apoptosis in vitro, examining the cellular process of programmed cell death. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743328171, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 82, "prompt_tokens": 226, "total_tokens": 308, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
