It functions as a **receptor for vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF)**, specifically binding to the **peptide Lv**. This protein is involved in both **angiogenesis**, the formation of new blood vessels, and **tissue repair**. It's also a target for anti-angiogenic drugs, which aim to inhibit its activity.  VEGFR2 exhibits changes in expression levels over time, particularly in response to training status. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743343578, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 109, "prompt_tokens": 257, "total_tokens": 366, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
