They play a crucial role in vascular development and function, contributing to the formation and maintenance of blood vessel networks. These cells are also studied in the OGD-SD model, which is used to investigate cellular responses to ischemia/reperfusion injury. Notably, FGD5, a protein involved in various cellular processes, regulates endothelial cell activity.  Furthermore, endothelial cells are essential for blood vessel development and formation. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743087947, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 103, "prompt_tokens": 203, "total_tokens": 306, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
