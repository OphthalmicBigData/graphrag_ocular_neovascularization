It can be applied to study protein expression in various contexts, including mice and human cells.  The method involves separating proteins based on their size using gel electrophoresis, followed by transferring the separated proteins to a membrane. The proteins are then detected using antibodies that specifically bind to the target proteins of interest. This allows for the visualization and quantification of specific protein levels. Western blotting is often used as part of a broader study to analyze protein expression levels and understand their role in various biological processes. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743303529, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 112, "prompt_tokens": 214, "total_tokens": 326, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
