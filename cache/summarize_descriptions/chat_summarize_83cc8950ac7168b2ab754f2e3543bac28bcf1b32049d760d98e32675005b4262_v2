It enables the visualization and analysis of MNV without requiring manual adjustments to segmentation lines. Specifically, cross-sectional OCTA allows for the detection of MNV lesions, including Type 3 MNV, which can be effectively assessed using OCTA imaging.  OCTA analyzes the vascular morphology of **MNV** in patients with nAMD (Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy). Detailed information on the vascular morphology of **MNV** in patients with nAMD is provided by OCTA.
