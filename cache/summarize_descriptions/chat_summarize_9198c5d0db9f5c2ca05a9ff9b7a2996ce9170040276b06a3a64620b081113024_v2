This process can occur in response to injury, such as skin wound healing or corneal burns, and is also studied in relation to angiogenesis.  It involves the growth of abnormal blood vessels, which can be quantified by measuring the number of new capillaries formed and the thickness of the newly formed capsule. \n\nNeovascularization has been studied extensively, with research focusing on its role in various conditions like Type 3 neovascularization, a condition that occurs in the retina.  The process is also observed in other tissues, such as tendon tissue, where new blood vessel formation can occur. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743141781, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 133, "prompt_tokens": 339, "total_tokens": 472, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
