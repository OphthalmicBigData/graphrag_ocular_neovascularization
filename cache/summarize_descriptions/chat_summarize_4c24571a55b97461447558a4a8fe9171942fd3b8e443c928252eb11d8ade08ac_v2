This condition can lead to vision loss and is often associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). MNV can be classified into different types, including Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3.  It's a medical condition that causes fluid build-up in the eye and can impact retinal nutrition.  MNV is a medical test with high accuracy and a good F1 score, used to measure the total MNV area and volume in eyes with pure type 1 or type 2 AMD. It can also be a component of AMD and is being studied as a potential target for treatment.  \n\n**Note:** The term \"MNV\" can refer to both a medical condition and a specific test, depending on the context. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743345224, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 189, "prompt_tokens": 354, "total_tokens": 543, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
