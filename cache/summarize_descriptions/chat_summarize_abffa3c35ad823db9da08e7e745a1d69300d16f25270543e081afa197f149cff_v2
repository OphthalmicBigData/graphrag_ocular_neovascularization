It is the location where hematopoietic stem cells, also known as Muse cells, originate and differentiate into different blood cells.  Bone marrow is also the birthplace of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which play a role in angiogenesis. Additionally, it houses CD34+ cells, a population of hematopoietic stem cells that are essential for blood cell production.  Furthermore, bone marrow is where fibrocytes reside, and mesenchymal stem cells can be derived from this tissue. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743216848, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 108, "prompt_tokens": 195, "total_tokens": 303, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
