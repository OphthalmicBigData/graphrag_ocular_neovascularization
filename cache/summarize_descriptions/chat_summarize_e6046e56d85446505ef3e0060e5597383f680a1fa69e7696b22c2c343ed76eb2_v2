It is involved in the creation of new blood vessels, known as angiogenesis, which is essential for tissue growth and repair.  \n\nHowever, VEGF also has a significant impact on pathological conditions. In tumorigenesis, it promotes the growth of tumors by stimulating angiogenesis. Additionally, VEGF plays a role in neovascular eye diseases like age-related macular degeneration (AMD). \n\nFurthermore, VEGF is implicated in kidney fibrosis, where its activity contributes to the development of scar tissue and impaired kidney function.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743255617, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 132, "prompt_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 333, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
