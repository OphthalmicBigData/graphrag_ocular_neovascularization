It is primarily recognized for its involvement in **angiogenesis**, the formation of new blood vessels.  VEGFA acts as a **growth factor** that stimulates angiogenesis by promoting the growth and proliferation of endothelial cells, which are responsible for forming new blood vessel walls. \n\nBeyond angiogenesis, VEGFA also contributes to **muscle development** through its role in gene expression. It is involved in the **BMP9-ID1 signaling pathway**, further highlighting its diverse functions within the body.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743343512, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 130, "prompt_tokens": 249, "total_tokens": 379, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
