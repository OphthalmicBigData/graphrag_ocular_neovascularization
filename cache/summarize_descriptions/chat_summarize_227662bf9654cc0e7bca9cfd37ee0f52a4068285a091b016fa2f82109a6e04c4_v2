They play a crucial role in blood vessel formation, repair, and angiogenesis (the process of new blood vessel growth).  Endothelial cells are also involved in tumor growth and angiogenesis.  They form the inner lining of blood vessels and respond to angiogenic stress.  Researchers use endothelial cells for experiments and studies on their biological functions, including those related to miR-106a's impact on autophagy and angiogenesis.  Additionally, they are targeted by BA NC@PM and are important for understanding Kavain's impact on the body. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743328181, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 139, "prompt_tokens": 418, "total_tokens": 557, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
