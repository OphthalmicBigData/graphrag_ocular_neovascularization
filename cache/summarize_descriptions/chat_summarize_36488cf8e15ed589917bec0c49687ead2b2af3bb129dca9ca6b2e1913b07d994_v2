It functions as an anti-angiogenesis drug, inhibiting angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels) to slow tumor growth and reduce vascularization.  It has been studied for its potential use in cancer treatment, including stage 3 retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), cervical cancer, and neovascularization. Bevacizumab is also used to treat corneal neovascularization. It inhibits angiogenesis by targeting specific proteins involved in the process.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743303493, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 111, "prompt_tokens": 340, "total_tokens": 451, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
