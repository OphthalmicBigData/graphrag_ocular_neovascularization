This process, also known as angiogenesis, is used to study the development and function of blood vessels.  It can be assessed using assays that investigate the effect of factors like FGF23 on tube formation.  This method allows researchers to observe how endothelial cells form tubes in vitro, providing insights into various biological processes such as vascularization and cell signaling. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743287074, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 91, "prompt_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 292, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
