It has been identified as being increased in invasive PA tissues, suggesting its involvement in tumor growth.  Furthermore, research indicates that **KCNQ1OT1** functions as a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cellular stemness within the context of PAs. This lncRNA is a focal point for study due to its potential impact on PA development, particularly in relation to cell invasion and proliferation. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743141893, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 127, "prompt_tokens": 210, "total_tokens": 337, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
