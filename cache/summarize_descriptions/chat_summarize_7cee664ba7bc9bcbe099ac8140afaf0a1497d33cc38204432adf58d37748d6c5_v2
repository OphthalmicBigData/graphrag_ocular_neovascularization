They contribute significantly to the tumor microenvironment (TME), where they create a hypoxic environment due to their role in oxygen supply and waste removal. Blood vessels are involved in tumor growth and development, often infiltrating tumors themselves. These tubes carry blood from the heart to various parts of the body, including bone tissue.  They can be found both within the body's natural structures and as part of specific research models like lung cancer cell lines. \n\nWhile their role in the body is vital for circulation, they are also implicated in tumor growth and development, particularly within the TME.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743182496, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 144, "prompt_tokens": 291, "total_tokens": 435, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
