It involves the growth of new blood vessels in the choroid, a layer of tissue beneath the retina. This process can lead to vision loss, particularly in elderly patients. CNV is a hallmark feature of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and can cause leakage of fluid in the eye.  It is a medical condition that needs to be predicted for treatment. \n\nCNV is studied in mouse models and is a late recurrence of CNV in elderly patients. It is also a rare cause of vision loss in children, and its study focuses on changes in CNV during the nonexudative period. The process of new blood vessel formation in the choroid (choroidal neovascularization) is a key factor in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743087909, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 176, "prompt_tokens": 411, "total_tokens": 587, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
