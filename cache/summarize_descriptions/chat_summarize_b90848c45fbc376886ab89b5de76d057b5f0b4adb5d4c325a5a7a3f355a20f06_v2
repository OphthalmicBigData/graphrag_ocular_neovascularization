They form the inner lining of blood vessels, including capillaries and contribute to blood vessel formation and repair. Endothelial cells are essential for angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels. They are also involved in wound healing and vascular augmentation, making them important targets for research into cardiovascular health and disease.  Endothelial cells are a key component of the body's circulatory system and were used in experiments studying angiogenesis. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743328206, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 110, "prompt_tokens": 312, "total_tokens": 422, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
