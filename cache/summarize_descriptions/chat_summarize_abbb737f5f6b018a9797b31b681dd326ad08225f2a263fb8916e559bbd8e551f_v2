This assay, also known as an **assay for measuring tube formation by endothelial cells**,  is used to evaluate the ability of cells to form tubes in response to various stimuli or treatments. It can be employed to assess the effects of a treatment on cell growth and migration, particularly in the context of angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels). The assay is also utilized to study tumor angiogenesis, where it helps measure the inhibitory activity of TDT-triVGB3 on human endothelial cells.  \n\nThe **TUBE FORMATION ASSAY** can be categorized as a method for measuring angiogenesis and tube formation in cells. It falls under the broader category of assays used to study cell tube formation and is often employed to investigate the effects of various factors on cellular processes related to angiogenesis. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743328248, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 179, "prompt_tokens": 264, "total_tokens": 443, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
