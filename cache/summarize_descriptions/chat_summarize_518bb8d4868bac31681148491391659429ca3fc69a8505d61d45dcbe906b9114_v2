It is a **growth factor** involved in this process, and its elevated levels are often correlated with increased angiogenesis. VEGF interacts with the **VEGFR-2** receptor, contributing to the growth and development of blood vessels. It has been studied as a potential treatment for various conditions, including **retinopathy of prematurity**, where it is being investigated for its ability to promote healthy blood vessel formation in premature infants.
