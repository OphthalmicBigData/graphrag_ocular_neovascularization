It is primarily recognized for its involvement in **angiogenesis**, the formation of new blood vessels.  VEGFA acts as a potent stimulator of angiogenesis, promoting the growth and development of new blood vessels. \n\nBeyond angiogenesis, VEGFA participates in several other cellular processes, including those related to inflammation and tumor growth. It is also implicated in uterine vascularization and has been shown to be regulated by certain treatments like TLB treatment.  Furthermore, VEGFA's expression levels can be modulated by siRNA targeting, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for various diseases. \n\nIn the context of corneal health, VEGFA plays a role in regulating inflammation within the cornea.  It is also linked to tumor growth and has been identified as a gene involved in both angiogenesis and the VEGF pathway. \n\n\n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743141823, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 194, "prompt_tokens": 271, "total_tokens": 465, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
