They play a crucial role in forming and maintaining blood vessels, including those found in tumor tissues.  These cells are involved in angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation, and are essential for blood vessel formation and repair. Endothelial cells are also studied for their response to various treatments, such as UMMC treatment, and their behavior in vitro when exposed to CTRP2. They form the inner lining of blood vessels and contribute significantly to the process of angiogenesis.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743182536, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 114, "prompt_tokens": 336, "total_tokens": 450, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
