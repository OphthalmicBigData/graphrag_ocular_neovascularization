It involves separating proteins based on their size using gel electrophoresis and then transferring them to a membrane, followed by detection of specific proteins using antibodies. This allows researchers to study the levels of various proteins in biological samples, including those from rats.  Western blotting can be used to detect protein expression, analyze protein expression levels, and study the expression of specific proteins like *NOX4*. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743182558, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 94, "prompt_tokens": 226, "total_tokens": 320, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
