It involves detecting specific proteins in a sample using antibodies that bind to the target proteins. This method can be used to evaluate various proteins, including neurofilaments, PDGF, Angiopoietin, AGGF1, VEGFR2, VEGFA, and phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.  Western blot is also a valuable tool for studying protein expression levels. It allows researchers to determine the levels of these proteins in a sample.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743303493, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 109, "prompt_tokens": 250, "total_tokens": 359, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
