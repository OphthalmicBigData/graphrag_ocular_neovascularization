They play crucial roles in various physiological processes, including angiogenesis (blood vessel formation), blood vessel growth and development, blood clotting, wound healing, and regulating blood flow. These cells are involved in both the structural integrity of blood vessels and their function in transporting oxygen and nutrients throughout the body. Endothelial cells were co-cultured with other cell types like OECs for research purposes and have been used extensively in studies related to the MHCI (Major Histocompatibility Complex I) pathway.  They are a key focus of research due to their involvement in various physiological processes, making them an important subject for understanding human health and disease. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743141760, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 158, "prompt_tokens": 303, "total_tokens": 461, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
