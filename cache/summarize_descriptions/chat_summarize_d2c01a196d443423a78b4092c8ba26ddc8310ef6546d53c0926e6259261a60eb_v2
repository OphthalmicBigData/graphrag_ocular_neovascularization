This complex ecosystem influences tumor growth, progression, and response to treatment.  It is characterized by hypoxia (low oxygen levels), interactions between tumor cells and immune cells, and the influence of various factors like cytokines and extracellular matrix components. The TME plays a crucial role in shaping the tumor's behavior and can be both beneficial and detrimental to its development. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743287062, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 108, "prompt_tokens": 273, "total_tokens": 381, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
