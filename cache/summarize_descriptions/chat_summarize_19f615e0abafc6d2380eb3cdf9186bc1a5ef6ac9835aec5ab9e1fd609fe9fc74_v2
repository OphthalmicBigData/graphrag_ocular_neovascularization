This condition is associated with poor postoperative angiogenesis, meaning the body's ability to form new blood vessels is impaired, particularly in patients with **MMD (Malignant Melanoma Disease)**.  High levels of HHCY are linked to negative outcomes in post-operative MMD patients, highlighting its potential role in cardiovascular complications. To assess cardiovascular risk, **HDL-C (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) and LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol)** are measured. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743158653, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 129, "prompt_tokens": 229, "total_tokens": 358, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
