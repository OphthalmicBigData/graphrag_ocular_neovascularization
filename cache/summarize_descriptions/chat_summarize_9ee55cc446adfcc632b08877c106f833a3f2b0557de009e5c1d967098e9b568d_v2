It plays a significant role in both **blood vessel formation** and **inflammation**. VEGF is a **growth factor** that promotes angiogenesis, and its production is stimulated by various stimuli, including high glucose levels (HG). It's also involved in **tumor growth** and has been linked to **wound healing**, **bone formation**, and the regulation of **angiogenesis-related diseases**.  \n\nThe protein's role in angiogenesis is further highlighted by studies showing that it is increased in **HPMCs** (hyperplastic myofibroblasts) and that its production can be suppressed by certain drugs like AXT107. Notably, research has shown that **Metformin**, a diabetes medication, can decrease VEGF immunostaining in diabetic rats, suggesting a potential therapeutic effect on angiogenesis-related conditions. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743216835, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 194, "prompt_tokens": 496, "total_tokens": 690, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
