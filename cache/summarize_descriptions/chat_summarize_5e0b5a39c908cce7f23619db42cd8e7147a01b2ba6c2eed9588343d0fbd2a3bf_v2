This process, often triggered by various ocular insults, can lead to vision loss. CNV can be caused by conditions like cataracts or age-related macular degeneration, and it is often treated with gene therapy.  It is also a measure of the effect of RBZ on CNV, and a term used in research to describe specific events related to blood vessel changes. \n\nCNV can manifest as various forms, including **Cataract Neovascularization** and **Myopic choroidal neovascularization**. It can be observed through different methods like laser-induced models or by analyzing cell number changes during inflammation.  The condition is also being followed up on and treated by ONS, a medical organization. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743182527, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 178, "prompt_tokens": 359, "total_tokens": 537, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
