Specifically, **TET2 deficiency** has been shown to impair angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation, by suppressing the STAT3 signaling pathway. Conversely, **TET2 overexpression** can alleviate hypoxia-induced dysfunction in endothelial cells, suggesting a protective effect. On the other hand, **TET2 knockdown** appears to exacerbate hypoxia-induced dysfunction in these cells, highlighting the importance of maintaining proper TET2 levels for optimal endothelial cell function under hypoxic conditions. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743218413, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 112, "prompt_tokens": 186, "total_tokens": 298, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
