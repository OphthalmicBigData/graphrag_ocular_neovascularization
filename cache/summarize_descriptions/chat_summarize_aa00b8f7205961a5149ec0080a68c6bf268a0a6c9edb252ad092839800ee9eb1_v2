Specifically, they are human umbilical vein endothelial cells, which play a vital role in angiogenesis, the process of blood vessel formation. These cells are commonly employed for research on topics such as tumor growth and metastasis, particularly in the context of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). HUVECs are also used to study the effects of VEGF-A, a protein involved in angiogenesis.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743216883, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 106, "prompt_tokens": 252, "total_tokens": 358, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
