Research indicates that low levels of the microRNA miR-877-3p expression are linked to a poorer prognosis for **OS** patients.  Conversely, studies have shown that overexpressing miR-877-3p can inhibit the proliferation of **OS** cell lines and suppress their angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels). This suggests that miR-877-3p may play a tumor suppressive role in **OS**.  Furthermore, research has identified potential targets for this miRNA, including the FGF2 signaling pathway, which could be explored as a therapeutic target for **OS**. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743088166, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 144, "prompt_tokens": 236, "total_tokens": 380, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
