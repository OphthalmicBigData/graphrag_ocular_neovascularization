It inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an important protein involved in blood vessel formation, and is effective in treating several diseases.  \n\nSpecifically, Bevacizumab is used for the following:\n\n* **Oncology:** It's used in chemotherapy and specifically targets certain cancers like non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n* **Eye Diseases:** It treats macular neovascularization (MN), a condition causing abnormal blood vessel growth in the eye. \n* **Other Diseases:** Bevacizumab is also used to treat osteoarthritis (OA) and other diseases, though its specific applications within these areas are not as well-defined.  \n* **Retinopathy:** It's particularly effective for treating aggressive posterior retinopathy of prematurity (APROP), a serious eye condition in premature infants. \n\nBevacizumab is also used in research studies to investigate various disease mechanisms and treatment strategies. \n\n\nIt's important to note that Bevacizumab can have side effects, and its use should be carefully considered by healthcare professionals based on individual patient needs and medical history.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743255654, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 243, "prompt_tokens": 264, "total_tokens": 507, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
