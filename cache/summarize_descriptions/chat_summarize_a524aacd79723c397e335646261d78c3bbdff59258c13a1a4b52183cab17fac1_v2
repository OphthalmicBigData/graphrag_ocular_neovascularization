It is primarily known as a **cell surface marker for blood vessels**, specifically endothelial cells, and plays a crucial role in **angiogenesis**, the formation of new blood vessels.  CD31 is also used to identify **sinusoidal endothelial cells**.  It can be detected using antibodies for immunostaining, allowing researchers to visualize its presence within tissues.  **CD31 is involved in both blood vessel formation and cell signaling**, contributing to immune responses as well. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743182522, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 116, "prompt_tokens": 221, "total_tokens": 337, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
