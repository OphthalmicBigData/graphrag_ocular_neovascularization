It has been employed to investigate the effects of BJ on proliferative diabetic retinopathy, oxygen-induced retinopathy, tumor growth and angiogenesis, as well as the impact of inhibitors on these processes.  Specifically, it's been utilized in studies of OSCC (oral squamous cell carcinoma) to understand how gene therapy can be applied, and for investigating changes in copy number variations (CNV). Additionally, this model has been used in L-CNV studies and to explore lymphangiogenesis. Notably, the **MOUSE MODEL** is a valuable tool for studying type 2 diabetes (T2D) due to its relevance to the disease's pathophysiology.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743158674, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 152, "prompt_tokens": 239, "total_tokens": 391, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
