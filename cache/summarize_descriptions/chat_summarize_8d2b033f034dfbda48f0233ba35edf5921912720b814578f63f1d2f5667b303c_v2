This condition, often seen in eye diseases, can disrupt corneal avascularity and lead to vision impairment.  It can be a major cause of blindness and significantly affect quality of life. Corneal neovascularization involves the formation of new blood vessels within the cornea, which can grow into normally avascular areas. This process is often triggered by injury or underlying eye diseases. While it can be treated with therapies like PDT (photodynamic therapy) and bevacizumab, corneal neovascularization remains a sight-threatening condition that requires careful management. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743303524, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 135, "prompt_tokens": 328, "total_tokens": 463, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
