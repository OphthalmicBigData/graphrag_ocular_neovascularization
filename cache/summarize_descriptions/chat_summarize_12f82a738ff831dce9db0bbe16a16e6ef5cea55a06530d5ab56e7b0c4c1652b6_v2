It is a key component for bone healing and is part of the skeleton. Bone tissue is a focus for regeneration and repair, with research being conducted on its properties and potential applications in bone tissue engineering.  The subject of study in this text, bone tissue, is also the focus of research into osseointegration, where bone tissue integrates with implants.  Bone tissue can be affected by traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and is a key area of study for understanding how to regenerate and repair damaged bone. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743255593, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 122, "prompt_tokens": 246, "total_tokens": 368, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
