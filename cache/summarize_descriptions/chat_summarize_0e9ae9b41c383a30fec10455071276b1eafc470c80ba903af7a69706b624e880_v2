This condition can lead to vision loss, as the new blood vessels may obstruct or damage the eye's natural structure and function.  It can be caused by various factors, including surgery, inflammation, and underlying diseases. \n\nThe process of corneal neovascularization involves the formation of new blood vessels on the surface of the cornea. This growth is often triggered by injury or inflammation, leading to a variety of symptoms such as blurred vision, pain, and sensitivity to light.  While it can be a symptom of other conditions like herpes simplex keratitis, it can also occur independently. \n\nCorneal neovascularization has been studied extensively as a model for treatment development, particularly in the context of corneal grafts. Researchers have used this condition to understand how new blood vessels form and grow on the cornea, ultimately contributing to advancements in ophthalmology.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743238556, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 194, "prompt_tokens": 301, "total_tokens": 495, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
