It is often associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and can be characterized by the gradual thinning of the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp vision. \n\nIn addition, **geographic atrophy** can also refer to a broader term encompassing the growth of the eye in general. This refers to the expansion of the eyeball itself, which can occur due to various factors such as age or certain medical conditions.  Finally, **geographic atrophy** is sometimes used to describe the growth rates of a specific geographical area, often related to population density or economic development. \n\n\n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743087907, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 143, "prompt_tokens": 156, "total_tokens": 299, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
