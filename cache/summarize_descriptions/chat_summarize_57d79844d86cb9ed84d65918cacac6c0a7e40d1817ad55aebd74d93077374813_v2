Derived from human umbilical veins, these cells are often used to investigate coronary heart disease and capillary formation. They can be found in various research settings, including co-culture experiments for MCL studies and <i>in vitro</i> experiments. These cells have been utilized to study the effects of drugs like APMCG-1 on ischemic endothelial cells and the impact of DFO on angiogenesis and progenitor cell recruitment.  They are also a source of human endothelial cells used in exosome studies. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743343555, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 129, "prompt_tokens": 303, "total_tokens": 432, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
