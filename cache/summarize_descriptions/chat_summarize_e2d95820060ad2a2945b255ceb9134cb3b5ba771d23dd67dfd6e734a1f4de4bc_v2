It's a **pro-angiogenic factor** meaning it promotes blood vessel formation and growth. VEGF-A is upregulated in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, indicating its importance in blood vessel development. \n\nThe protein is involved in both **tumor growth and angiogenesis**. It can be measured as an antibody level, and studies have shown that levels of VEGF-A are elevated in various cancers, including gastric cancer.  It's also a key player in the formation of new blood vessels, making it a significant target for therapies aimed at treating diseases like cancer. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743255605, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 154, "prompt_tokens": 265, "total_tokens": 419, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
