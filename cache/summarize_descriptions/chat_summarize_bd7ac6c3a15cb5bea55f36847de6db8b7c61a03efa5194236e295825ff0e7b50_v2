It can manifest as a variety of conditions affecting the eye and other parts of the body.  Specifically, CNV refers to **choroidal neovascularization**, a condition that affects the eye's choroid, potentially leading to vision loss. This condition can also be observed in patients with other related diseases or lesions. \n\nThe term \"CNV\" is often used in medical contexts to describe various conditions, including chronic neovascularization and those associated with tissue damage.  It is important to note that the specific meaning of CNV may vary depending on the context. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743328180, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 142, "prompt_tokens": 272, "total_tokens": 414, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
