It involves separating proteins based on their size using gel electrophoresis, followed by transferring the separated proteins to a membrane.  Antibodies specific to the target protein are then applied to the membrane, allowing for detection of the protein's presence through a colorimetric or chemiluminescent reaction. This technique is also used to detect changes in protein expression levels and has applications in various fields such as research and diagnostics. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743238539, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 104, "prompt_tokens": 181, "total_tokens": 285, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
