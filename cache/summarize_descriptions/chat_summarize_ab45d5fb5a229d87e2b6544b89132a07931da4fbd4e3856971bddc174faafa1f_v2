It involves blocking blood flow to the middle cerebral artery, leading to ischemia and mimicking the effects of a stroke. This model is particularly useful for studying brain injury and recovery mechanisms, as well as angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels).  MCAO models are also employed in research to understand the physiological processes involved in stroke and its complications. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743141750, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 101, "prompt_tokens": 205, "total_tokens": 306, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
