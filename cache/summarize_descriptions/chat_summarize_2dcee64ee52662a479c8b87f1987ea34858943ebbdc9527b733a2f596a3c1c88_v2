This membrane plays a crucial role in various studies, particularly in angiogenesis research.  It serves as an in vivo model for studying cell migration and vascular development due to its ability to support the growth of blood vessels. Notably, the CAM has been used to investigate the migration abilities of cells like HepG2 and U87, where their movement is suppressed within this membrane environment. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743287118, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 108, "prompt_tokens": 175, "total_tokens": 283, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
