It can manifest as various eye conditions, including **choroidal neovascularization (CNV)**, which involves the abnormal growth of blood vessels in the retina. This condition can cause vision loss and necessitates treatment.  \n\nCNV is linked to oxidative stress and systemic inflammation, making it a complex medical condition that requires careful management. Research on CNV focuses on understanding its mechanisms and developing effective treatments, including potential therapies using DEX@INHANGs. Studies have been conducted in both humans and mice to investigate the effects of CNV treatment. \n\nCNV can be influenced by genetic variation, leading to changes in gene expression levels.  It is also associated with other eye conditions like cataracts and central nervous system vasculitis. The severity of CNV can vary significantly, impacting vision and potentially leading to serious ophthalmological consequences, especially in children. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743328180, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 202, "prompt_tokens": 446, "total_tokens": 648, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
