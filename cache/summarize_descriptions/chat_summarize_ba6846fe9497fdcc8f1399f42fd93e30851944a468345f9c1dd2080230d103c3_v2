It's a crucial medical problem, as delayed wound healing can lead to complications like infection and impaired recovery.  This process encompasses various stages, including cell migration and invasion, which are assessed using assays.  While it's a fundamental biological process for tissue repair, smoking can significantly delay wound healing. Research on wound healing is ongoing, with challenges in clinical and experimental settings worldwide. \n\nThe descriptions highlight the multifaceted nature of wound healing, encompassing its definition as a medical problem, its role in treating ischemic disorders, and its measurement through various assays.  It's also recognized as a process for repairing damaged tissue after injury, including tissue regeneration following an injury. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743182503, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 156, "prompt_tokens": 309, "total_tokens": 465, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
