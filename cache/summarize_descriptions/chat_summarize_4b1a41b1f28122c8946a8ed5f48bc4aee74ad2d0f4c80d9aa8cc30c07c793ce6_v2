It's an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that measures the levels of specific proteins in a sample, such as IL-21, FGF23, Serpin E1, VEGFA, B7-H3, and inflammatory factors.  ELISA can be used to detect VEGF, soluble B7-H3, and various disease markers in the peripheral blood of patients. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743287075, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 114, "prompt_tokens": 259, "total_tokens": 373, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
