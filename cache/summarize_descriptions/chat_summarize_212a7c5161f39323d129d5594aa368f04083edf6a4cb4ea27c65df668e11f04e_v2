It serves as a model for studying human diseases, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (mBMSC), skeletal muscle, and hindlimb ischemia.  Mice are particularly valuable for research on CNV (Copy Number Variation) and tumor growth. They have been employed in studies investigating the interaction between pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells and O-Ad, as well as in wound healing and ischemic stroke research. The mouse model is also used to analyze interactions between PDAC cells and O-Ad, study CNV, and investigate hindlimb ischemia.  Furthermore, mice are utilized in medical research and various studies exploring the role of genes like *Crk* and *Crkl*. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743255616, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 155, "prompt_tokens": 319, "total_tokens": 474, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
