This condition can lead to vision loss and is often associated with various eye diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, and retinal vein occlusion.  It can occur as a result of HCMV infection or be triggered by imbalances in angiogenic factors. \n\nThe process involves the formation of new blood vessels within the retina, which can contribute to vision impairment if not managed effectively. This condition has been studied extensively in animal models like mice, where it is observed in the context of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743303557, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 133, "prompt_tokens": 294, "total_tokens": 427, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
