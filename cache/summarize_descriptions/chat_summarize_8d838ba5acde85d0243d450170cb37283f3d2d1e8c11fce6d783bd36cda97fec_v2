It is a **pro-angiogenic factor** and a **growth factor** involved in both normal physiological processes and tumor growth. VEGF stimulates **cell growth and survival**, and its expression is regulated by various factors, including hypoxia-inducible factor-1 subunit alpha (HIF-1α).  \n\nVEGF levels are influenced by different stimuli, such as sugar intake, and can be measured to assess angiogenesis. It has been found to be highly expressed in LCI rats, a model used for studying **blood vessel** formation. VEGF is also involved in the development of tumors, where it promotes tumor growth and angiogenesis. \n\nThe protein is often studied in research related to **treatment**, particularly in bone reconstruction, as it can be secreted from bone marrow stem cells.  It has been found to increase in the pancreas of diabetic rats treated with MCP, indicating its potential role in managing diabetes. VEGF levels have also been measured and compared between fresh and frozen fat samples. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743089681, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 227, "prompt_tokens": 602, "total_tokens": 829, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
