Exosomes can also regulate cell function and are being investigated as potential therapeutic agents due to their involvement in both health and disease.  Their size makes them nanoparticles, and they participate in a variety of functions, such as communication between cells and the transport of molecules. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743255756, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 98, "prompt_tokens": 215, "total_tokens": 313, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
