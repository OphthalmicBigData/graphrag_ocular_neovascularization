This process can occur in several contexts: \n\n* **Eye:**  Abnormal blood vessel growth in the eye is often associated with conditions like diabetic retinopathy or age-related macular degeneration.\n* **Body:** Neovascularization occurs throughout the body as a response to ischemia (lack of blood flow), contributing to plaque vulnerability and potentially serving as a treatment option for certain diseases. \n* **Adipose Tissue:**  Neovascularization can also occur in adipose tissue, where new blood vessels form in response to specific stimuli.\n\nWhile neovascularization is essential for healthy tissue repair and perfusion, uncontrolled growth of blood vessels can lead to complications like retinal detachment or even contribute to the recurrence of certain conditions like CSDH (Congenital Subretinal Hemorrhage).  This process is a double-edged sword, playing a vital role in tissue repair and perfusion but also potentially leading to problems like plaque vulnerability and retinal detachment.\n\n**Further details on neovascularization:**\n\n* **Mechanism:** Neovascularization involves the growth of abnormal blood vessels, often triggered by injury or ischemia. This can be quantified through measuring the number of new capillaries formed and the thickness of newly formed capsules.\n* **Research Focus:**  Extensive research focuses on understanding neovascularization's role in various conditions like Type 3 neovascularization, a condition that occurs in the retina. The process is also observed in other tissues, such as tendon tissue, where new blood vessel formation can occur. \n\n\nThis summary provides a comprehensive overview of neovascularization, highlighting its essential role in physiological functions and potential complications associated with uncontrolled growth.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743143326, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 376, "prompt_tokens": 540, "total_tokens": 916, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
