They are crucial for healing and tissue repair, as angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is key to immune defense and wound closure.  However, blood vessels can be compromised by factors such as hyperthermia, which could lead to blockage.  Furthermore, their involvement in the pathophysiology of heart failure (HO) has been observed.  Specifically, blood vessels are involved in transporting blood throughout the body, and new blood vessels formed with strong CD31 expression have been identified. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743328761, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 123, "prompt_tokens": 217, "total_tokens": 340, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
