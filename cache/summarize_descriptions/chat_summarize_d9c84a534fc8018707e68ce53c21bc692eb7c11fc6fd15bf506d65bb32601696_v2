It is activated under hypoxic conditions, leading to its activation and subsequent regulation of **angiogenesis**, **cell migration**, and **VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)** expression.  HIF-1α also regulates the **regulation of HIF-1α and VEGF**, impacting angiogenesis and cellular response to hypoxia. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743182511, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 150, "prompt_tokens": 317, "total_tokens": 467, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
