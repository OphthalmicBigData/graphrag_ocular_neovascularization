Studies have shown that **ROS** are involved in both normal and abnormal angiogenesis, with their production being linked to uncontrolled growth. These reactive oxygen species are produced during cellular processes and can be measured in grafted and non-grafted tissue as a way to understand their impact on tissue health. Research has focused on the role of **ROS** in angiogenesis, aiming to better understand how these molecules contribute to both healthy and pathological angiogenesis. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743182682, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 123, "prompt_tokens": 188, "total_tokens": 311, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
