This assay is often employed in research to study stemness, angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels), and senescence (aging).  It involves endothelial cells growing into tubes, providing insights into their tubule-forming capabilities. The tube formation assay has been used to investigate the function of circZEB1, a specific molecule involved in cell behavior. This method is also utilized to study angiogenesis, which is crucial for tissue development and repair. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743328234, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 119, "prompt_tokens": 246, "total_tokens": 365, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
