It is involved in both cell signaling pathways and the angiogenesis process, making it an important target for various biological processes.  AKT is also implicated in cancer progression. \n\nHere's a breakdown of its roles:\n\n* **Cell Signaling:** AKT participates in numerous cellular signaling pathways, including those related to growth, survival, and metabolism.\n* **Angiogenesis:** It plays a role in the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis), which is essential for tissue development and repair. \n* **Cancer Progression:**  AKT's involvement in cell signaling and angiogenesis makes it a potential target for cancer therapies.\n\n\n**Note:** The descriptions mention \"Akt\" as well, but this is likely referring to the same protein entity. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743216848, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 174, "prompt_tokens": 227, "total_tokens": 401, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
