It is employed in various applications, including analyzing protein expression levels and detecting protein expression.  This method can be used to validate the results of network pharmacology analysis and quantify autophagy. Western blotting is also utilized to study the effects of PNS (presumably referring to peripheral nervous system). \n\nThe technique involves separating proteins based on their size using gel electrophoresis followed by transfer to a membrane, where they are then detected with specific antibodies.  It can be used to study protein expression in various contexts, including cell lines like Y79 cells. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743343507, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 122, "prompt_tokens": 264, "total_tokens": 386, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
