It involves utilizing a colorimetric reagent that reacts with cellular metabolic activity to produce a measurable signal proportional to the number of viable cells. This assay can be combined with flow cytometry experiments to provide detailed insights into cell populations and their characteristics.  The CCK-8 method is also commonly used for assessing cell viability, allowing researchers to determine the percentage of living cells within a sample. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743141806, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 108, "prompt_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 308, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
