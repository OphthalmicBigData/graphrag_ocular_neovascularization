They play a crucial role in angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels.  These cells are used extensively in research and medical applications due to their involvement in various biological processes, including wound healing and blood vessel formation. HUVECs are particularly important for studying angiogenesis, as they can be targeted by extracellular vesicles (EVs) and used in EndMT cell models. They have been studied in numerous experiments, including those investigating the effects of SAR on cells in vitro.  HUVECs are a mature type of cell that is often used in research to assess the effects of various substances or treatments on blood vessel formation. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743343525, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 150, "prompt_tokens": 326, "total_tokens": 476, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
