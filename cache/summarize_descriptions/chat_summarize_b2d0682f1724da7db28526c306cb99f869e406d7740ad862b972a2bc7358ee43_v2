It encompasses various mechanisms, including angiogenesis, which uses new blood vessel formation to deliver nutrients and oxygen to damaged tissues.  This process can be studied using assays to investigate the effects of factors like FGF23, as well as through experiments examining the impact of stem cell secretome on wound healing in diabetic rats.  WOUND HEALING is a complex process that involves repairing and regenerating damaged tissue, ultimately leading to complete closure of wounds. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743287030, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 111, "prompt_tokens": 310, "total_tokens": 421, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
