It is best known for its involvement in **angiogenesis**, the formation of new blood vessels, and is often studied in research related to **cell signaling**. VEGF promotes angiogenesis by stimulating the growth of endothelial cells, which line blood vessels.  It is also involved in **tumor growth** as it can contribute to the development and spread of tumors. \n\nThe protein's role extends beyond angiogenesis, with studies showing its involvement in **nerve regeneration**, **cell signaling pathways**, and even treatment for **vision problems**. VEGF is a key player in the body's ability to repair tissues and maintain healthy blood vessel function.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743287027, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 150, "prompt_tokens": 299, "total_tokens": 449, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
