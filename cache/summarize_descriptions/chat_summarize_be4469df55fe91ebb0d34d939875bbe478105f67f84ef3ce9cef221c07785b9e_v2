It acts as a growth factor, activating **VEGFR2** and promoting the growth of blood vessels. VEGFA is involved in both cell growth and development, and its activity has been linked to various physiological processes, including wound healing and tumor angiogenesis. However, it's also associated with a poor prognosis in certain diseases.  Research on VEGFA has utilized techniques like real-time PCR to evaluate its expression levels. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743158714, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 126, "prompt_tokens": 263, "total_tokens": 389, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
