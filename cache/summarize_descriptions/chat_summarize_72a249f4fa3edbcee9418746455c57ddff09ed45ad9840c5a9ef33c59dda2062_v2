They are particularly important for studying the effects of various factors on blood vessel formation and function, including the impact of stress (SE) on endothelial cells. HUVECs are often employed in experiments to investigate angiogenesis and migration, allowing researchers to study these processes in vitro. They are a crucial component of the **H/R model**, which is used to simulate heart failure conditions.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743328212, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 104, "prompt_tokens": 300, "total_tokens": 404, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
