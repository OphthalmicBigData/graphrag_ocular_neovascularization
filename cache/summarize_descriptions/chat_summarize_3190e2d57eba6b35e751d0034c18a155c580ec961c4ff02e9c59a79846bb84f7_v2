It is particularly useful for studying blood vessel changes, including those related to myopic macular neovascularization (qMNV).  OCTA devices are used to capture 3×3-mm scans that can detect MNV and help diagnose and monitor patients with this condition. This noninvasive imaging modality allows researchers to observe the intricate network of blood vessels in the eye, providing valuable insights into ocular health.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743343545, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 109, "prompt_tokens": 305, "total_tokens": 414, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
