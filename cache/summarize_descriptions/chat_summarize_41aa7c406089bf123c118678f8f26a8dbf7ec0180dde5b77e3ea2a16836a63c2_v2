It's characterized by damage to the macula, the part of the retina responsible for sharp, detailed vision.  AMD can be further categorized as exudative AMD, where fluid builds up in the macula, and non-exudative AMD, which involves changes in the cells of the macula. The study focused on eyes with exudative AMD, examining its relationship to other eye conditions like mMNV (multifocal motor neuropathy) that share genetic susceptibility. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743343544, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 118, "prompt_tokens": 257, "total_tokens": 375, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
