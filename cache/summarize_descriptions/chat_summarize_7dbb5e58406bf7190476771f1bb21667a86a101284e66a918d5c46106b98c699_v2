It can be inhibited by drug delivery systems and is a hallmark of cancer.  This process plays a significant role in various contexts, including tumor development, eye health (specifically the retina), and tissue regeneration after ischemia. \n\nNeovascularization can occur in several locations, such as the eye (where it's linked to abnormal neovascularization) or near the graft site. It is studied in the context of predicting myopic choroidal neovascularization prognosis.  The process itself is described as new blood vessel growth in various tissues and organs, including the retina, body, and eye. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743255658, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 148, "prompt_tokens": 364, "total_tokens": 512, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
