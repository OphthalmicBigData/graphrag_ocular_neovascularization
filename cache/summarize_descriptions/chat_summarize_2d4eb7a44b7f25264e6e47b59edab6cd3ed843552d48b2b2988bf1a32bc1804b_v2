It plays a crucial role in providing structural support, influencing cell behavior, and facilitating various biological processes.  Specifically, the ECM is involved in endothelialization, where it helps cells lining blood vessels attach to each other. The ECM also serves as a structure that provides clues for angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels. Additionally, the ECM contributes to periosteum regeneration by creating a microenvironment conducive to tissue repair and growth. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743216991, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 110, "prompt_tokens": 184, "total_tokens": 294, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
