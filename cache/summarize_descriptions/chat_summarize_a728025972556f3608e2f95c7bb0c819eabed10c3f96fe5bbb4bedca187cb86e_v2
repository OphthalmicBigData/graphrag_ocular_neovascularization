It is involved in RNA metabolism, contributing to the stability and processing of messenger RNA (mRNA).  Furthermore, IGF2BP2 participates in cell proliferation and tube formation, suggesting its involvement in tissue development and growth. Notably, it stabilizes <i>FGF2</i> mRNA, which is a signaling molecule crucial for various cellular functions.  In addition, IGF2BP2 has been implicated in the development of breast cancer, highlighting its potential role in tumorigenesis. Finally, this protein promotes angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, suggesting its involvement in vascularization and tissue repair processes. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743343612, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 139, "prompt_tokens": 192, "total_tokens": 331, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
