It serves as an important tool for studying biological processes, particularly in areas such as retinopathy, T. cruzi infection, colorectal cancer, and corneal neovascularization.  Mice are small animals commonly employed in scientific research to investigate the effects of different treatments on biological processes. They have been used extensively in studies examining bone defects, with one example being a study where mice were used to test the effect of MBG-NH<sub>2</sub>/IGF@SF on bone defects. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743182494, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 115, "prompt_tokens": 276, "total_tokens": 391, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
