It is primarily known for its involvement in **angiogenesis**, the formation of new blood vessels, and is essential for both healthy development and disease progression.  \n\nSpecifically, VEGF is involved in:\n\n* **Diabetic retinopathy:** A condition where abnormal blood vessel growth leads to vision loss.\n* **Tumor growth:** VEGF promotes tumor angiogenesis, allowing tumors to access nutrients and grow more aggressively. \n* **Blood vessel formation:** VEGF stimulates the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, which are crucial for forming new blood vessels.\n\nVEGF is a cytokine, meaning it acts as a signaling molecule that regulates various cellular processes.  It's also known as **Vascular-endothelium growth factor** and is often referred to simply as **VEGF**. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743141830, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 179, "prompt_tokens": 230, "total_tokens": 409, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
