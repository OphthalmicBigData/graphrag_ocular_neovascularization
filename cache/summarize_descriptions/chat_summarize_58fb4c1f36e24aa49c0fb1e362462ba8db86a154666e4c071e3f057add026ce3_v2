This process can be affected by various factors, including Rh2 and anti-angiogenic agents.  It involves both tumor development and expansion, leading to tumour growth and spread.  The rate of tumour growth can be slowed down by certain interventions like inhibiting angiogenesis (EC).  Tumour growth is a measurable and studied phenomenon, with researchers investigating its mechanisms and potential treatments. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743303537, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 101, "prompt_tokens": 231, "total_tokens": 332, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
