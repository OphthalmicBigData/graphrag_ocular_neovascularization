It plays a significant role in **mechanotransduction**, allowing cells to sense physical forces and translate them into biochemical signals.  Furthermore, **NOTCH1** is involved in **cell fate decisions during angiogenesis**, the formation of new blood vessels. This protein also functions as part of a signaling pathway that regulates **cell development and differentiation**.  In essence, **NOTCH1** acts as a key player in cell signaling and development, impacting both cellular responses to external stimuli and internal developmental processes. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743238642, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 119, "prompt_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 310, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
