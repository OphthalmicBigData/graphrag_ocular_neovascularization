This metric can be applied to various conditions, including **gastric cancer**, where it refers to the overall survival rate of patients diagnosed with this type of cancer. Additionally, **OS** may also refer to **overall survival time**, indicating the duration of life for individuals after a particular event or condition. \n\n\n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743141854, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 135, "prompt_tokens": 168, "total_tokens": 303, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
