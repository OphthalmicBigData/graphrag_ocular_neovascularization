It can occur in various locations, including the eye and brain.  \n\nIn the **eye**, neovascularization is a key target for treating ocular diseases like blindness caused by conditions such as diabetic retinopathy. It also plays a role in corneal allograft rejection, where abnormal blood vessel growth occurs. \n\nNeovascularization can be observed in the **posterior pole** of the eye and contributes to improved blood flow in the heart.  It is also linked to the spread of intraocular choroidal melanoma (ICCM). \n\n\nWhile neovascularization can have positive effects like improving blood flow, it can also lead to complications such as blindness if not properly managed. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743216837, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 151, "prompt_tokens": 307, "total_tokens": 458, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
