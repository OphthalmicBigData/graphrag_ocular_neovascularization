It acts as a receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and its activation by VEGF triggers various cellular processes involved in angiogenesis.  Furthermore, VEGFR-2 plays a significant role in inhibiting tumor growth. This inhibition is attributed to its ability to regulate cell proliferation and migration, ultimately hindering the uncontrolled growth of tumors. Notably, VEGFR-2 has been identified as a target for therapeutic interventions, with specific inhibitors like TISSB2 being developed to modulate its activity and potentially treat various diseases. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743343562, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 131, "prompt_tokens": 180, "total_tokens": 311, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
