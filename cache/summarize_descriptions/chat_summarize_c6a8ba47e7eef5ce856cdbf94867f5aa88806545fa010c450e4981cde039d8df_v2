It is primarily known for its involvement in **angiogenesis**, the formation of new blood vessels, and **cell growth**. VEGF also contributes to **inflammation** and **tumor development**.  It is a key component of the **VEGF signaling pathway**, which regulates vasculogenesis (formation of blood vessels), angiogenesis (new blood vessel formation), and lymphangiogenesis (formation of lymphatic vessels).  \n\nThe protein's influence extends beyond its role in vascular development. It has been studied for its effects on **tumor growth** and its potential as a therapeutic target for various cancers. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743217652, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 141, "prompt_tokens": 322, "total_tokens": 463, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
