They play crucial roles in various physiological processes, including angiogenesis (blood vessel formation), blood flow regulation, and oxygen transport.  These cells are essential for maintaining healthy blood vessels and are often studied in research to understand their function in health and disease. \n\nEndothelial cells are commonly used in co-culture models and angiogenic assays to study the development of new blood vessels. They are also a key component of tumor microenvironments, where they can be manipulated to mimic hypoxic conditions and study how tumors adapt to these changes.  Various endothelial cell lines have been developed for research purposes, including those used to evaluate angiogenic potential and mimic tumor hypoxia. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743286996, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 157, "prompt_tokens": 383, "total_tokens": 540, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
