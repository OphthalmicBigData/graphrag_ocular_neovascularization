It is also involved in **collagen synthesis** and **blood vessel growth**. VEGF is a key player in **kidney repair and regeneration**, acting as a growth factor.  \n\nThe protein's influence extends to various biological processes, including:\n\n* **Tumor growth:** VEGF promotes tumor growth by stimulating angiogenesis.\n* **Eye development:** VEGF plays a role in eye development. \n* **Vascularization:** It is a vascularization marker, indicating the presence of new blood vessels.\n* **Immune response:**  VEGF expression has been observed in Non-Classic Lipomas and its immunoexpression can be analyzed using antibodies.\n\n**VEGF levels** are often measured in studies to assess their impact on various biological processes. For example, **decreased VEGF levels** have been observed in certain conditions like those treated with 500 IU for 24 hours.  \n\n**VEGF injections** are used to treat **MNV (Multi-system Inflammatory Syndrome)**.  It is also a key component of the **Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor pathway**, which regulates blood vessel formation and growth.\n\n\nIn summary, VEGF is a vital protein involved in angiogenesis, collagen synthesis, and various other biological processes. Its role in tumor growth, eye development, and vascularization makes it a significant target for research and therapeutic interventions. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743238553, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 310, "prompt_tokens": 415, "total_tokens": 725, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
