Specifically, they are often used for treating conditions like neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), which involves abnormal blood vessel growth in the macula of the eye. These injections involve delivering antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) medications directly into the vitreous humor, the gel-like substance that fills the eye's interior.  The long-term outcomes of these IVI treatments have been studied extensively for patients with type 3 macular neovascularization (MNV), a specific subtype of nAMD where abnormal blood vessels are present in the macula. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743303472, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 137, "prompt_tokens": 199, "total_tokens": 336, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
