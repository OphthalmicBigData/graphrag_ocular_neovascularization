It acts as a receptor for **VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)**, promoting the growth of new blood vessels.  This receptor tyrosine kinase plays a crucial role in both angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels) and fibrosis (tissue scarring).  It's targeted by lentiviral vectors designed to silence its activity, highlighting its importance in various biological processes. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743343618, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 107, "prompt_tokens": 315, "total_tokens": 422, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
