Specifically, HUVECs are human umbilical vein endothelial cells, which are commonly used in research to study these processes. These cells can be found in the umbilical vein and are often isolated and cultured for use in laboratory settings. They are also used in angiogenesis assays, a method for studying the growth of new blood vessels. \n\nHUVECs are crucial for understanding wound healing as well.
