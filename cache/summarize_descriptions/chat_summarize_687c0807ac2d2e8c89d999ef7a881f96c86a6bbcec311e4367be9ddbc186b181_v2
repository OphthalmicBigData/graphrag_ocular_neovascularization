It occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow on the back of the eye, leading to leakage and vision loss. CNV can cause cataracts and other eye diseases.  It's an area of study for researchers investigating subretinal fibrosis and its connection to various eye conditions.  CNV lesions were observed in the BA treated group, indicating a potential link between this condition and treatment outcomes.  The condition is often studied using laboratory techniques like laser-induced CNV. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743345220, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 116, "prompt_tokens": 276, "total_tokens": 392, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
