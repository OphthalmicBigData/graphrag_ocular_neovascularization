It measures protein expression levels and evaluates the presence of specific proteins within a sample.  This method, also known as Western blot analysis, involves separating proteins based on their size using gel electrophoresis and then transferring them to a membrane. The proteins are then detected using antibodies that bind specifically to the target proteins, allowing for visualization of the protein bands. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743216879, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 85, "prompt_tokens": 190, "total_tokens": 275, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
