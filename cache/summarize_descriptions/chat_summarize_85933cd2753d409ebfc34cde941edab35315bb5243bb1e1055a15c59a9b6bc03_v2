It's a biological entity that develops from cells and can be classified as a type of cancer or disease.  Tumors are characterized by their mass of abnormal cells and can potentially become cancerous. They can also be targeted for treatment, with specific sites being considered for intervention. Research on tumors focuses on understanding their development, progression, and potential treatments. \\n\\n**Tumor** descriptions often include terms like \\\"growth of tumor,\\\" \\\"tumor tissue samples for study,\\\" \\\"tumor location,\\\" and \\\"tumors are abnormal growths of cells.\\\" These descriptions highlight the nature of tumors as masses of abnormal cells that can grow and spread.
