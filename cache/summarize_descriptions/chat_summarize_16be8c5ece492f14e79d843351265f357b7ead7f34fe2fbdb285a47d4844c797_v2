Furthermore, blood vessels are a focal point in medical research, particularly in tumor studies where researchers investigate how they contribute to disease progression. Their role in angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels that support tumor growth, is significant. Additionally, blood vessel properties influence tissue stiffness, and their relationship to this phenomenon is being studied by researchers.
