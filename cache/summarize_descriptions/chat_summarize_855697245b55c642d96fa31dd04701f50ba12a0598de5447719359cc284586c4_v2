They are essential for the development and homeostasis of bone tissue as well.  These cells are also studied in the context of RGD ligands and are often used in co-culture experiments, chord formation studies, and research on angiogenesis. Endothelial cells line blood vessels both inside the body and within specific tissues like the eye.  They can be enhanced by exosomes and are a key component of the endothelium, which is responsible for forming blood vessels. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743303482, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 122, "prompt_tokens": 334, "total_tokens": 456, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
