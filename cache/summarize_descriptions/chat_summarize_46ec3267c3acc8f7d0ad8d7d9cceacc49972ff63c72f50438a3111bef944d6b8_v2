They are responsible for wound healing by producing proteins essential for the formation of new tissue. Fibroblasts also regulate cardiac hypertrophy, meaning they influence the growth of heart muscle cells.  They are commonly used in research studies and contribute to understanding various biological processes. Additionally, fibroblasts create a microenvironment that influences cell behavior and interactions within tissues. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743238669, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 99, "prompt_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 292, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
