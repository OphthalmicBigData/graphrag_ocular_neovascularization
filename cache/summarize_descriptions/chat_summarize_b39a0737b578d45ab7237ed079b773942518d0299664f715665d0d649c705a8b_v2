This condition can lead to vision loss and is often associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). MNV can be caused by various factors, including genetic predisposition and certain medical interventions.  It's a complex condition that can impact retinal nutrition and potentially cause fluid build-up in the eye. \n\nMNV is a type of eye condition that can lead to monocular vision loss. It is also a component of AMD and can be measured using specific techniques, such as imaging studies. MNV has been studied extensively, with researchers investigating its causes, treatments, and impact on patients' visual acuity.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743343545, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 159, "prompt_tokens": 375, "total_tokens": 534, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
