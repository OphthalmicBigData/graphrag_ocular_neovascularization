They are essential components of the immune system, engulfing and destroying pathogens as part of their function.  Furthermore, macrophages contribute to bone formation and repair, angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels), and regulate the development of age-related macular degeneration.  Their immunoregulatory effects influence the progression of various diseases, including those related to CNV (choroidal neovascularization).  Macrophages are also involved in HIF signaling pathways, highlighting their complex role in cellular processes. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743158671, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 131, "prompt_tokens": 288, "total_tokens": 419, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
