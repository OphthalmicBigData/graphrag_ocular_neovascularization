These cells play a crucial role in blood vessel formation and are commonly used in research to study various biological processes, including angiogenesis (blood vessel growth), migration, and invasion, particularly in the context of breast cancer.  They are also utilized for studying the effects of specific compounds like Lyc on angiogenesis and Geniposide's impact on angiogenesis. These cells are a valuable tool for researchers investigating these cellular mechanisms. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743158737, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 111, "prompt_tokens": 244, "total_tokens": 355, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
