It functions as a receptor tyrosine kinase, meaning it receives signals from other molecules and triggers cellular responses.  While VEGFR2 can promote angiogenesis by activating downstream pathways that stimulate blood vessel development, it also inhibits angiogenesis under certain conditions. This dual role highlights the complex nature of its function in both healthy tissues and disease states. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743158641, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 112, "prompt_tokens": 223, "total_tokens": 335, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
