This method is often used in research, particularly when studying angiogenesis and metastasis.  It involves using living organisms as subjects for research, allowing scientists to observe biological processes within a natural environment. The study location can be either an actual living organism or a simulated environment that mimics the conditions found in living organisms. In vivo analysis was performed on living organisms to investigate anti-inflammatory properties. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743087895, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 97, "prompt_tokens": 205, "total_tokens": 302, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
