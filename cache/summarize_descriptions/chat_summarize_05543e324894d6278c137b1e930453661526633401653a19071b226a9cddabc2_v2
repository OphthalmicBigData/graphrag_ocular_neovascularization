This process, often leading to vision impairment, can be a significant cause of vision loss in diseases like proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR).  It is typically detected using widefield OCT angiography, which provides detailed images of the retina's vascular network. RNV involves the formation of new blood vessels within the retina, and understanding its mechanisms is crucial for developing effective treatments to prevent or manage vision loss associated with various eye diseases. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743286979, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 114, "prompt_tokens": 209, "total_tokens": 323, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
