They are particularly important for studying the development and function of blood vessels, as they play a crucial role in forming tubes and contributing to blood vessel formation. HUVECs are also used in studies focused on **LOXL2 silencing**, where their behavior is investigated under specific conditions. Additionally, these cells are employed in biocompatibility testing to assess their compatibility with other materials.  They are commonly referred to as **human umbilical vein endothelial cells** and are a valuable tool for understanding human biology and disease processes. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743216856, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 132, "prompt_tokens": 270, "total_tokens": 402, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
