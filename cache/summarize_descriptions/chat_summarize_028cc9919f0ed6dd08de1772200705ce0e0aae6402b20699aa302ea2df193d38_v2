It plays a role in **angiogenesis**, the formation of new blood vessels, and **apoptosis**, programmed cell death.  It also influences **cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation**. Notably, MIR-21 has been linked to **colitis progression** in mice models, suggesting its potential involvement in inflammatory bowel diseases. Research on **MIR-21's effect on angiogenesis** is ongoing, highlighting its importance as a target for therapeutic interventions related to blood vessel development and disease. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743141784, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 123, "prompt_tokens": 188, "total_tokens": 311, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
