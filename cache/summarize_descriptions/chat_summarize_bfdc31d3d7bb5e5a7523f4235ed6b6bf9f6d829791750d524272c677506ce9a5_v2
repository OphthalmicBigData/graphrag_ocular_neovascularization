It functions as both an inhibitor of angiogenesis and endothelial cell migration, suppressing the growth of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) and movement of endothelial cells. However, it also exhibits pro-growth properties, being overexpressed to potentially alleviate ischemic stroke.  Furthermore, MEG3 acts as a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), attenuating RNV activity. Notably, MEG3 can be secreted by tumor cells, acting as a growth factor that promotes cell proliferation. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743182641, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 112, "prompt_tokens": 205, "total_tokens": 317, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
