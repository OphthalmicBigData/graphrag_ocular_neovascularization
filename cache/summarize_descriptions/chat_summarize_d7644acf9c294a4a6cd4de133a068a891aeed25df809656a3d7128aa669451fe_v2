It plays a vital role in various physiological processes, including tissue repair, wound healing, and tumor growth. Angiogenesis is stimulated by cell therapy for treating hypoxia-related diseases and contributes to AVF failure.  It also promotes cancer cell growth, diffusion, and metastasis. \n\nAngiogenesis is essential for tumor progression and metastasis. It can be enhanced by various factors such as HOXD13 and plays a role in the Warburg effect and osteoarthritis development.  The process of new blood vessel formation is crucial for tissue regeneration and oxygen supply to damaged tissues. Research on angiogenesis focuses on understanding its mechanisms and potential therapeutic applications, including treating ischemic stroke and diabetic wounds. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743343489, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 153, "prompt_tokens": 1214, "total_tokens": 1367, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
