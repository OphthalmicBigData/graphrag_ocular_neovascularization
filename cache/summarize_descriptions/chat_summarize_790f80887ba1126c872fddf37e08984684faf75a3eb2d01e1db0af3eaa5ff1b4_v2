This process can occur in various locations, including the eye (where it's often associated with abnormal blood vessel growth in the retina), the brain (after XST administration), and even in tissue engineering.  It can also be used to aid wound healing. \n\nDescriptions highlight that neovascularization is a complex process that can manifest in different ways:\n* **Eye:** It can occur as an abnormal growth of blood vessels in the retina, leading to conditions like diabetic retinopathy.\n* **Body:** It's a broader term for new blood vessel formation throughout the body, often used in tissue engineering and wound healing applications. \n* **Specific Locations:**  Neovascularization is specifically mentioned in relation to the carotid artery (blood vessels in the neck) and tumors.\n\nThe process of neovascularization can be described as \"formation of new blood vessels\" or \"new blood vessel growth,\" emphasizing its role in creating new vascular networks. \n\n\n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743345223, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 212, "prompt_tokens": 336, "total_tokens": 548, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
