It functions as a **growth factor**, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. VEGFA plays a crucial role in the regulation of the extracellular matrix and is associated with the development of **ccRCC** (clear cell renal cell carcinoma). Its expression and secretion are correlated with SHB activation, indicating its involvement in signaling pathways related to tumor growth.  VEGFA is also known as **Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A**, a protein that promotes angiogenesis by stimulating the formation of new blood vessels. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743087916, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 137, "prompt_tokens": 280, "total_tokens": 417, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
