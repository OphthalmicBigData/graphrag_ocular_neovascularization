It's also an area of interest for treatment and research, particularly in the context of intravitreal injections.  MNV is a measure of vascular maturity, and its study focuses on understanding the effects of these injections on the disease. The term \"MNV\" can refer to both the outer region of the body (e.g., \"Outer MNV\") and the specific area affected by macular neovascularization in the eye.  \n \n **Note:** While \"MNV\" is often used as a shorthand for \"Macular Neovascularization,\" it's important to remember that the term can have different meanings depending on the context. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743216910, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 163, "prompt_tokens": 234, "total_tokens": 397, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
