It is primarily known for its involvement in **angiogenesis**, the formation of new blood vessels, and is considered a key growth factor in this process.  VEGFA also contributes to **tumor growth** by promoting angiogenesis within tumors. Additionally, it influences **vascular permeability**, affecting how easily fluids move through blood vessels. \n\nBeyond angiogenesis, VEGFA is involved in **brain injury** processes related to angiogenesis. It's a target for **miR-agshRNAs**, which are small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression.  VEGFA also contributes to **wound healing** and cell function.  It is often referred to as **Vegfa** or simply **VEGFA**. \n\n\n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743303523, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 168, "prompt_tokens": 273, "total_tokens": 441, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
