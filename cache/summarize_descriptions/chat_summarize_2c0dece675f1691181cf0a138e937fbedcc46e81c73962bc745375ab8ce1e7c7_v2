They are responsible for transporting blood throughout the body, facilitating vital processes like nutrient delivery and waste removal.  Blood vessels are also involved in tumor angiogenesis, where they contribute to the growth of new blood vessels that support tumor development.  They are directly affected by sesquiterpene treatment, and their structure and function can be studied in relation to tissue stiffness.  Furthermore, blood vessels play a key role in angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels.  These vessels are found in various locations within the body, including those involved in tissue regeneration.  Connexins, proteins that regulate cell-to-cell communication, have been identified in certain blood vessel types. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743087938, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 156, "prompt_tokens": 288, "total_tokens": 444, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
