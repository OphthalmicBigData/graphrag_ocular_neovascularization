Angiogenesis, a crucial biological process, refers to the formation of new blood vessels from existing ones. It is essential for tissue repair and regeneration.  Tissue engineering aims to create functional tissues or organs using cells, scaffolds, and growth factors. The highly controlled process of angiogenesis is vital in tissue engineering as it provides the necessary blood supply for cell survival and tissue development. Tissue engineering can be used to improve angiogenesis by creating a suitable environment for new blood vessel formation. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743158898, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 110, "prompt_tokens": 186, "total_tokens": 296, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
