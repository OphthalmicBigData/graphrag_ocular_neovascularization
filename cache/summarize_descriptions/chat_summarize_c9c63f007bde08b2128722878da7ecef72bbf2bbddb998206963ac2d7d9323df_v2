It acts as a receptor for **VEGF-A**, a protein involved in angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels).  It's also implicated in the inflammatory response, with its expression observed in animals treated with human tumor prostate cells (hTPC). Notably, VEGFR2 is activated by the P<sub>1</sub> coding sequence. Research suggests that **VEGFR2** plays a significant role in angiogenesis and may be targeted by BMP9 for this purpose.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743089695, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 112, "prompt_tokens": 228, "total_tokens": 340, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
