They can be children like the 11-year-old female patient treated for retinal disease, or adults such as the 18-year-old female with NF1.  Patients may experience various conditions, including breast cancer and those undergoing cell therapy or immunotherapy treatments. Some patients are lost to follow-up but later return for diagnosis, while others are actively receiving treatment for conditions like CNV. The patient is also the individual undergoing examination and treatment, specifically the one who received treatment for CNV.  Finally, the term \"patient\" can refer to individuals with specific medical conditions such as those diagnosed with NF1. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743345215, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 151, "prompt_tokens": 258, "total_tokens": 409, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
