They play a crucial role in various physiological processes, including angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels), blood vessel formation and maintenance, and blood flow regulation.  These cells are involved in both the structural development of blood vessels and their functional properties. Endothelial cells are studied extensively in research related to angiogenesis, as they are directly responsible for forming new blood vessels and responding to signals from other cells like bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells (BM-MNCs). They are also a key focus in understanding how blood vessels function and respond to various stimuli.  Endothelial cells can be derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells, offering potential for cell-based therapies and research models. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743255599, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 154, "prompt_tokens": 321, "total_tokens": 475, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
