VEGF is involved in both normal physiological processes like wound healing and tissue repair, as well as pathological conditions such as cancer, where it contributes to tumor growth and metastasis.  It is a key player in neoangiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels during tissue regeneration or disease progression. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743328174, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 113, "prompt_tokens": 215, "total_tokens": 328, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
