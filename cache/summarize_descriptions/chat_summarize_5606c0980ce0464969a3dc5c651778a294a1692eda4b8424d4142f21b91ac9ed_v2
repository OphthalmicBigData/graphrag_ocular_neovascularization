It serves as a valuable tool for understanding various biological processes and testing potential treatments.  Mice are employed in numerous studies across diverse fields, including those investigating oxygen-induced retinopathy, angiogenesis, gene therapy, and the effects of WNK1 disruption on angiogenesis.  They are also used to study the impact of Hebp1 on angiogenesis and the properties of mouse bone mesenchymal stem cells.  The use of mice in research is evident through their presence in numerous studies, including those involving in vivo permeability assays. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743158636, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 123, "prompt_tokens": 286, "total_tokens": 409, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
