It is particularly useful for studying blood vessels in the retina, specifically in diagnosing and monitoring patients with myopic macular neovascularization (MNV).  OCTA scans are typically 3×3-mm in size and can be used to detect MNV. The technique involves capturing cross-sectional images of the eye's blood vessels using light waves. This noninvasive imaging modality allows for detailed analysis of vessel changes, making it a valuable tool for ophthalmologists.  OCTA is also known as \"dynamic video color OCT angiography\" and can be used to study other conditions like qMNV (quantitative macular neovascularization). \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743345224, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 158, "prompt_tokens": 297, "total_tokens": 455, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
