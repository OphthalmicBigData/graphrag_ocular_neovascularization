They are found in the vascular endothelium and contribute to blood vessel formation, maintenance, and repair. Endothelial cells are involved in angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels, and are essential for blood clotting and wound healing. They also play a vital role in the activation of mitochondria and the mTOR pathway. \n\nEndothelial cells are studied extensively in various contexts, including mouse models and research on the effects of genetic modifications (e.g., knockout) on angiogenesis.  They are a key focus in understanding vascular biology and its implications for health and disease. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743303501, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 141, "prompt_tokens": 409, "total_tokens": 550, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
