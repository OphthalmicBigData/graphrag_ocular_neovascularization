This lack of oxygen, also known as **low oxygen levels**, can lead to various physiological changes.  It can induce the downregulation of miR-214 and upregulate ALOX5 expression. Hypoxia has been linked to increased VEGF expression, a protein involved in angiogenesis (blood vessel formation). It is often described as a condition where there is a reduced oxygen supply in tissues or cells. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743343484, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 108, "prompt_tokens": 269, "total_tokens": 377, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
