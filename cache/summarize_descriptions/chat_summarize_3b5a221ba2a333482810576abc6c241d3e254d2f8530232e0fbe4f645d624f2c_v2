It's located at the back of the eye and plays a crucial role in converting light into electrical signals that are sent to the brain for processing.  The retina contains photoreceptor cells (rods and cones) which are sensitive to light, and it also houses blood vessels that supply nutrients to the tissue. The retina is affected by various conditions such as diabetic retinopathy, where abnormal blood vessel growth can lead to vision loss. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743089691, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 104, "prompt_tokens": 338, "total_tokens": 442, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
