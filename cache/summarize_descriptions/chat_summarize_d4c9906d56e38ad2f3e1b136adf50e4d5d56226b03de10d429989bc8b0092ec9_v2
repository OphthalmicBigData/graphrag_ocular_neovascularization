It functions as a transcription factor, regulating the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis, tumor growth, metastasis, and cellular adaptation to low oxygen levels. HIF-1α stabilizes under hypoxic conditions, making it a key player in the cellular response to hypoxia.  It is also targeted by various drugs, including GP inhibitors, and its activity is linked to the BMP9-ID1 signaling pathway. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743343516, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 120, "prompt_tokens": 289, "total_tokens": 409, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
