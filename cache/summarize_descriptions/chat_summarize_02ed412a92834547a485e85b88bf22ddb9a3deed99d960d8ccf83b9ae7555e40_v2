It serves as a marker for both immune cells and endothelial cells, which are key components of the circulatory system.  CD31 is expressed on some cells and can be used to identify specific cell types through immunohistochemistry or immunostaining techniques. \n\nThis protein is involved in angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, and cell-cell interactions. It also plays a role in immune response by interacting with other immune cells. CD31 is often used as an indicator of wound healing due to its presence on endothelial cells, which are essential for tissue repair.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743343513, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 138, "prompt_tokens": 238, "total_tokens": 376, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
