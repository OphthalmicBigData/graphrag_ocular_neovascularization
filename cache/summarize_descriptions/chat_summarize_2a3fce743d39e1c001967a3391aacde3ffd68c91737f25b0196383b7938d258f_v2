It plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including **cell growth and development**, **inflammatory responses**, and the induction of **epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)**.  **TGF-β signaling pathways** are central to these functions, acting as both stimulators and inhibitors depending on the context. \n\nSpecifically, TGF-β is a **growth factor** that promotes tumor vasculature formation and contributes to **fibrosis**. It's also implicated in **corneal epithelial healing**, **bone repair**, and the study of **CRC cell growth**.  Furthermore, **TGF-β signaling pathways** are being investigated for their role in various diseases, including cancer. \n\n\n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743303529, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 168, "prompt_tokens": 241, "total_tokens": 409, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
