They line the inner surface of blood vessels, forming a continuous layer known as the endothelium. These cells play crucial roles in blood vessel formation and growth, contributing to vascular development and maintenance.  Endothelial cells also interact with other cells and molecules, including those involved in the process of angiogenesis (blood vessel formation). Notably, endothelial cells are particularly sensitive to biological signals called \"BREs\" (likely referring to \"bradykinin receptors\"), which can influence their function and behavior. Endothelial cells are a subject of study in various fields, including vascular biology and medicine, as they provide insights into the complexities of blood vessel development and disease processes. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743216823, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 142, "prompt_tokens": 208, "total_tokens": 350, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
