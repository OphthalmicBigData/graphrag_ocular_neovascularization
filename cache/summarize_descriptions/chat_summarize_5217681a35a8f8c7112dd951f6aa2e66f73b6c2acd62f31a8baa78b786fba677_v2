This process plays a crucial role in various physiological functions, including tissue repair, perfusion of ischemic areas, and wound healing.  It occurs throughout the body as a response to ischemia (lack of blood flow), contributing to plaque vulnerability and potentially serving as a treatment option for certain diseases. \n\n**Applications:**\n\n* **Eye:** Abnormal blood vessel growth in the eye is often associated with conditions like diabetic retinopathy or age-related macular degeneration.\n* **Body:** Neovascularization occurs throughout the body as a response to ischemia, contributing to plaque vulnerability and potentially serving as a treatment option for certain diseases. \n* **Adipose Tissue:**  Neovascularization can also occur in adipose tissue, where new blood vessels form in response to specific stimuli.\n\n**Contradictions:** While some descriptions mention neovascularization in the central nervous system, others focus on its role in the retina and cornea. It's important to note that neovascularization is a complex process with diverse applications across different tissues. \n\n**Methods & Treatments:**\n\n* **PRP Treatment:** Neovascularization can be stimulated by platelet-rich plasma (PRP) treatment, leading to increased blood vessel formation.  \n\n**Mechanism:** Neovascularization involves the growth of abnormal blood vessels, often triggered by injury or ischemia. This process is quantified through measuring the number of new capillaries formed and the thickness of newly formed capsules. \n\n**Further details on neovascularization:**\n\n* **Research Focus:** Extensive research focuses on understanding neovascularization's role in various conditions like Type 3 neovascularization, a condition that occurs in the retina.

It is a hallmark of late-stage diabetic retinopathy and occurs in response to ischemia, meaning insufficient blood flow.  It can also occur as a result of other conditions like Moyamoya disease, where it's treated surgically.  Neovascularization provides tumors with nutrients and oxygen for growth. In the context of eye health, neovascularization is often observed in diabetic retinopathy, leading to abnormal blood vessel formation that can damage the retina.  Studies have documented neovascularization as a result of PDR (diabetic proliferative retinopathy). The process of new blood vessel formation is also referred to as **neovascularization**. \\n\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gemma2:2b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_summarize_5217681a35a8f8c7112dd951f6aa2e66f73b6c2acd62f31a8baa78b786fba677_v2"}
