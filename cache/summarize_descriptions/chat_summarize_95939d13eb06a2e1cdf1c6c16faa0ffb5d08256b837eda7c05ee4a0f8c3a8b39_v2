It is involved in regulating various cellular processes, including cell growth, proliferation, survival, and metabolism.  AKT belongs to the serine/threonine kinase family and is often referred to as **Protein Kinase B (PKB)**. AKT functions within a signaling pathway known as the AKT pathway, which is essential for proper cell function and communication. This pathway is involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth, proliferation, survival, and metabolism. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743141785, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 111, "prompt_tokens": 224, "total_tokens": 335, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
