It serves as an animal model for studying various biological processes, including angiogenesis, human biology, brain repair mechanisms, and the effects of apoptosis reduction and motor enhancement.  Zebrafish are particularly valuable for investigating these topics due to their genetic similarities to humans and their transparent embryos, which allow researchers to observe developmental stages easily. Additionally, zebrafish have been used in research on ctu1 deficiency and other specific biological phenomena. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743343584, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 111, "prompt_tokens": 233, "total_tokens": 344, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
