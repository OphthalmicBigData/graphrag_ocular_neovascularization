It can be caused by the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the eye, leading to vision impairment or complete blindness. This condition can result from corneal neovascularization, where new blood vessels form on the cornea, or from neovascular glaucoma, a complication of increased pressure within the eye. Vision loss is often described as a consequence of AMD and can be a significant health concern for individuals experiencing it. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743287063, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 120, "prompt_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 313, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
