It refers to the ability of tumors to develop resistance to medication, hindering treatment effectiveness and posing a major obstacle in cancer therapy. This resistance can manifest as a side effect of intravitreal anti-VEGF agents, impacting their overall efficacy. \n\n\n**Note:** The provided descriptions are consistent and provide a comprehensive overview of drug resistance.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743255623, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 115, "prompt_tokens": 288, "total_tokens": 403, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
