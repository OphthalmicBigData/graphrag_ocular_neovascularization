It is primarily used to treat various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and has been approved for the treatment of central serous chorioretinopathy. Bevacizumab inhibits angiogenesis, which is the formation of new blood vessels, by targeting specific proteins involved in this process.  It can be used in clinical settings to starve tumors and inhibit their growth. \\n\\nWhile it's primarily known for its use in cancer treatment, Bevacizumab has also been studied for its potential in treating other conditions like MNV (multiple myeloma) and CNV (central nervous system).
