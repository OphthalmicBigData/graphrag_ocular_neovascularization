This type of cancer can spread to other parts of the body, making it a highly aggressive malignant tumor with high morbidity and mortality rates.  It has been identified as the leading tumor worldwide, and its progression was recently inhibited in vivo by Ibrutinib. Notably, breast cancer is known for causing metastasis, meaning the cancer cells can spread to distant areas of the body. \\n\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gemma2:2b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_summarize_301343e47d6a7e2975088f0173a208258c2069f9bba81dc75ea053dcc24e6d5c_v2"}
