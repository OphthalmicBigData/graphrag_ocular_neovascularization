These cells play a complex role in the body, often exhibiting both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory properties.  While they are found throughout the body, their location can vary depending on the specific context. M2-type macrophages are generally considered to be more pro-tumorigenic than other macrophage subtypes, meaning they may contribute to tumor growth and progression.  Macrophages can also be classified into two main categories: M1 and M2.  M1 macrophages are typically associated with an inflammatory response and are involved in fighting infection and clearing debris. In contrast, M2 macrophages are more involved in tissue repair and wound healing, and may contribute to tumor growth depending on the specific context. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743158823, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 158, "prompt_tokens": 183, "total_tokens": 341, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
