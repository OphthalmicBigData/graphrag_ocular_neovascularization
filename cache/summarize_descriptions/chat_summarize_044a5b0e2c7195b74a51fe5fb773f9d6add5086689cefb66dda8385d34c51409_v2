They are a type of connective tissue cell found throughout the body.  Fibroblasts play crucial roles in wound healing, where they contribute to skin repair and collagen production for tissue regeneration. \n\nThey interact with other cells, such as gastric cancer cells (GC cells), and influence their behavior. Fibroblasts also produce extracellular matrix components like collagen, which are essential for structural support and cell migration.  Their ability to migrate and proliferate is important for wound healing and tissue repair. Notably, after infection by *Helicobacter pylori*, fibroblasts express Serpin E1, a protein involved in immune response. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743286996, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 154, "prompt_tokens": 265, "total_tokens": 419, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
