It functions as a growth factor, influencing cell migration, angiogenesis, and even the transformation of cells from one type to another (EndMT).  While TGF-β itself does not directly promote angiogenesis, its presence can influence the overall microenvironment, potentially impacting blood vessel formation. Notably, studies have shown decreased levels of TGF-β in HCT116 tumor tissue following combined treatment with C-1305 and PTX, suggesting a potential role for this pathway in cancer progression. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743158601, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 126, "prompt_tokens": 216, "total_tokens": 342, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
