It can detect CNV in eyes with hyperreflective materials, with an accuracy rate of 83.3% for nAMD eyes and 91.3% for PNV eyes. OCTA's ability to visualize changes in CNV after treatment is a significant advantage, as it allows for monitoring the progression and response to therapy.  OCTA is also used to measure CNV size and severity, providing valuable data for clinical assessment. Additionally, OCTA may predict exudative recurrence and offer additional parameters for monitoring neovascular AMD. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743088155, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 149, "prompt_tokens": 228, "total_tokens": 377, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
