It can manifest as either corneal neovascularization, where new blood vessels form on the cornea, or choroidal neovascularization, which involves abnormal blood vessel growth in the choroid. CNV is a subtype of exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and can be studied for treatment options, including those targeting HRMECs (hyperreflective micro-vessels).

It can also manifest as **Cataract Neovascularization** and **Myopic choroidal neovascularization**.  Researchers study CNV using methods like slit lamp microscopy and laser-induced CNV formation in mice models. The condition's progression and impact on vision are studied through the clinical phenotype of CNV in AMD, providing valuable insights into the condition's development. Genetic variation associated with CNV can be suppressed using CRISPR-Cas9 technology.  CNV is also a measure of the effect of RBZ on CNV, and a term used in research to describe specific events related to blood vessel changes. \n\n\n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743185988, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 291, "prompt_tokens": 543, "total_tokens": 834, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
