It involves separating proteins based on their size using gel electrophoresis, followed by transferring the separated proteins to a membrane.  Antibodies are then used to specifically bind to the target protein of interest, allowing for its detection through various methods like chemiluminescence or fluorescence. This analysis can be applied to investigate cell migration and EMT capabilities, as well as detect myocardial fibrosis-associated markers. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743087979, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 97, "prompt_tokens": 169, "total_tokens": 266, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
