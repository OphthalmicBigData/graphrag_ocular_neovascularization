It involves abnormal growth of blood vessels in the choroid, a layer of tissue beneath the retina.  This can lead to vision loss and is often associated with other conditions like age-related macular degeneration (AMD). \n\n**CNV** is a type of genetic variation that can be observed in both the **central nervous system** and the **eye**. It's also a term used for research, particularly in mouse models.  Researchers study CNV to understand its mechanisms and develop potential treatments for eye diseases like AMD. \n\n\nThe descriptions provided highlight various aspects of CNV:\n\n* **Areas of the eye:** CNV lesions are compared among different groups in studies.\n* **Regrowth:** CNV may experience regrowth, potentially contributing to vision loss.\n* **Genetic variation:** CNV is a type of genetic variation that can be observed in both the central nervous system and the eye. \n* **Eye condition:** CNV is a specific condition affecting the eye. \n* **Mouse model:**  CNV research often utilizes mouse models for studying its mechanisms.\n\n\nIt's important to note that some descriptions may contradict each other, but this summary aims to provide a comprehensive overview based on available information. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743217654, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 273, "prompt_tokens": 251, "total_tokens": 524, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
