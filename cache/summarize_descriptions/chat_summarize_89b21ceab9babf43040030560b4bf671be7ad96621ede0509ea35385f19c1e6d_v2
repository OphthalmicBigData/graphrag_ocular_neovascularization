They form the basic unit of life and are essential for various biological processes.  Cells can exist in a confluent state, meaning they are densely packed together, and are often used in research settings to study cellular behavior and function. These cells are also found within the diabetic wound microenvironment, highlighting their role in tissue repair and regeneration. Importantly, living cells that can be studied in vitro (outside of a living organism) provide valuable tools for understanding cell biology and disease mechanisms. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743216826, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 111, "prompt_tokens": 186, "total_tokens": 297, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
