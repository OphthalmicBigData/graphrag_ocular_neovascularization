This lack of oxygen can induce significant changes in gene expression and cellular function.  It can also enhance the release of angiogenesis-related factors, contributing to tumor growth and development. Hypoxia is often associated with the **tumor microenvironment**, where low oxygen levels are a common feature. It can be caused by various factors, including exposure to low oxygen environments or limited blood flow. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743255586, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 105, "prompt_tokens": 244, "total_tokens": 349, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
