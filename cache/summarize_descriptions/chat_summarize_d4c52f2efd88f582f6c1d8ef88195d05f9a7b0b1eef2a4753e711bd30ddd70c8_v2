It plays a crucial role in menstruation, and is also involved in tissue lining the uterus.  It's part of the female reproductive system and is located within the uterus. The endometrium is affected by adenomyosis, a condition where the endometrium thickens abnormally. Research on endometrial cancer often focuses on this tissue. Additionally, the endometrium is essential for implantation during pregnancy and is involved in angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels).  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743158611, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 106, "prompt_tokens": 250, "total_tokens": 356, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
