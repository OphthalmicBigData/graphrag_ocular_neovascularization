It exhibits potent anti-angiogenic properties, inhibiting angiogenesis by interfering with blood vessel formation.  Furthermore, Celastrol demonstrates potential anticancer and anti-inflammatory effects. Notably, it inhibits microglia activation and inflammation, suggesting its role in modulating immune responses. Additionally, Celastrol has been shown to inhibit CNV (choroidal neovascularization), a condition associated with age-related macular degeneration. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743158818, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 101, "prompt_tokens": 199, "total_tokens": 300, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
