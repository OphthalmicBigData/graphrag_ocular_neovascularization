This process occurs throughout the body as a response to ischemia (lack of blood flow), contributing to plaque vulnerability and potentially serving as a treatment option for certain diseases. \n\n**Applications:**\n\n* **Eye:** Abnormal blood vessel growth in the eye is often associated with conditions like diabetic retinopathy or age-related macular degeneration.\n* **Body:** Neovascularization occurs throughout the body as a response to ischemia, contributing to plaque vulnerability and potentially serving as a treatment option for certain diseases. \n* **Adipose Tissue:**  Neovascularization can also occur in adipose tissue, where new blood vessels form in response to specific stimuli.\n\n**Contradictions:** While some descriptions mention neovascularization in the central nervous system, others focus on its role in the retina and cornea. It's important to note that neovascularization is a complex process with diverse applications across different tissues. \n\n**Methods & Treatments:**\n\n* **PRP Treatment:** Neovascularization can be stimulated by platelet-rich plasma (PRP) treatment, leading to increased blood vessel formation.  \n\n**Mechanism:** Neovascularization involves the growth of abnormal blood vessels, often triggered by injury or ischemia. This process is quantified through measuring the number of new capillaries formed and the thickness of newly formed capsules. \n\n**Further details on neovascularization:**\n\n* **Research Focus:** Extensive research focuses on understanding neovascularization's role in various conditions like Type 3 neovascularization, a condition that occurs in the retina.
