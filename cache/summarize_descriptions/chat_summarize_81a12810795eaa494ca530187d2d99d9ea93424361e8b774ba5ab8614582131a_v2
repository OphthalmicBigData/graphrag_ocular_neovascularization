It is a signaling molecule and growth factor that promotes the formation of new blood vessels. VEGF-A is involved in both normal physiological angiogenesis, such as wound healing and tissue repair, and tumor angiogenesis, where it contributes to the development and spread of tumors.  Stimulation of VEGF-A leads to an upregulation of its own expression, further promoting angiogenesis. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743087937, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 105, "prompt_tokens": 267, "total_tokens": 372, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
