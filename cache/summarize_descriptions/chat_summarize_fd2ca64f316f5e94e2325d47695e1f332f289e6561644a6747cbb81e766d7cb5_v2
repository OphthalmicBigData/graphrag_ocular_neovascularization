It is particularly valuable for studying various biological processes, including anti-angiogenic properties, blood vessel development, and tumor angiogenesis.  Zebrafish are also utilized in research on human diseases, developmental biology, and the G2/M transition. They are often employed as a model organism due to their genetic similarities to humans and their transparent embryos, which allow for easy observation of biological processes. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743287049, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 107, "prompt_tokens": 268, "total_tokens": 375, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
