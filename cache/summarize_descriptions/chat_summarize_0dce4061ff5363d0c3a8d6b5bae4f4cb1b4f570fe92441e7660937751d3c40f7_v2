It improves the viability of skeletal muscle cells under high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) by protecting them from damage caused by this condition.  Furthermore, salidroside has been shown to suppress hyperglycemia-induced ferroptosis, a type of cell death that can be triggered by high glucose levels. Additionally, salidroside enhances skeletal muscle cells' ability to revascularize and improve blood perfusion in diabetic mice with heart failure (HLI). \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743216841, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 107, "prompt_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 307, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
