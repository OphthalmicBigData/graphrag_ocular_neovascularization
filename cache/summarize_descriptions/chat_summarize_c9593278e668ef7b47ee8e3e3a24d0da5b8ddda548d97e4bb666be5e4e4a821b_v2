It can be applied to study various biological processes, such as angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels) and neurogenesis (development of new neurons).  Immunofluorescence staining involves using antibodies that specifically bind to target molecules, followed by fluorescent dyes that allow visualization under a microscope. This technique allows researchers to visualize the location and distribution of these molecules within cells and tissues, providing valuable insights into their function and role in biological processes. Additionally, immunofluorescence can be used to study PGF expression (prostaglandin F2α) and visualize cell structures. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743087934, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 136, "prompt_tokens": 175, "total_tokens": 311, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
