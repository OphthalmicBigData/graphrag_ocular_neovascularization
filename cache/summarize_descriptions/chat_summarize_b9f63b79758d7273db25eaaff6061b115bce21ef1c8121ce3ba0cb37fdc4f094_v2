It can lead to vision loss and requires treatment. MNV is often associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and may be related to hypoperfusion.  \n\nThere are various types of MNV, including Type 1 and Type 3, which have distinct characteristics and potential causes. While some forms of MNV are known complications of other conditions like posterior polar syringomyelia (PPS), others remain under investigation.  MNV is a subject of ongoing research, with researchers studying its markers and exploring treatment options. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743217659, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 140, "prompt_tokens": 336, "total_tokens": 476, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
