They are essential components of the immune system, engulfing and destroying pathogens as part of their function.  Furthermore, macrophages contribute to bone formation and repair, angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels), and regulate the development of age-related macular degeneration. Their immunoregulatory effects influence the progression of various diseases, including those related to CNV (choroidal neovascularization). Macrophages are also involved in HIF signaling pathways, highlighting their complex role in cellular processes. \\n\\nIn addition to these roles, macrophages play a significant part in tumor growth and metastasis. They contribute to both the inflammatory response and wound healing, contributing to tissue repair.  Furthermore, macrophages produce VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), which is essential for angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels. These cells also contribute to the immune system by fighting tumors and playing a role in chemical burn-induced corneal injury. Macrophages are found within tissues and infiltrate them to perform their functions, including immune surveillance and clearance of harmful agents. They contribute to bone metabolism, tissue repair, and the inflammatory response. \\n\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gemma2:2b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_summarize_ae71f33fc721b9fa74dc1da8ca79de974ba533cc196f05ebfa7cd3d3dd365afa_v2"}
