It is also a significant indicator of angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels.  This protein can be used to measure new vessels in the cornea and assess neovascularization. CD31 is particularly relevant in the context of breast cancer, as it's associated with blood vessels involved in tumor progression. Researchers utilize immunofluorescent staining to detect CD31 expression and evaluate angiogenic activity. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743328185, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 109, "prompt_tokens": 223, "total_tokens": 332, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
