They play crucial roles in both the inflammatory response and tissue repair. These cells express Sema4D and are found throughout the body, including the retina. Macrophages contribute to fighting off infections and tumors by regulating their growth. \n\nSpecifically, they are involved in:\n\n* **Angiogenesis:** Regulating the ability of new blood vessels to form.\n* **Inflammation:**  Contributing to both acute and chronic inflammatory responses.\n* **Tissue Repair:**  Playing a role in repairing damaged tissues.\n* **Immune Response:**  Fighting off infections and tumors. \n\n\n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743328172, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 164, "prompt_tokens": 246, "total_tokens": 410, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
