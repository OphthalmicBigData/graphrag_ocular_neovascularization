It's an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that measures the levels of these proteins, including those related to angiogenesis and inflammation.  ELISA can detect various proteins such as VEGF, soluble B7-H3, IL-21, FGF23, Serpin E1, VEGFA, and inflammatory factors in samples like peripheral blood of patients. It is commonly employed for analyzing inflammatory cytokines, molecules crucial to immune responses. The **ELISA** method can detect these markers in various samples like blood or tissue.
