It involves culturing cells in controlled laboratory environments to observe their behavior and responses to stimuli. This approach allows researchers to study cellular processes such as Endothelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EndMT) and bone formation in a more precise and controlled setting compared to in vivo models. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743182502, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 105, "prompt_tokens": 196, "total_tokens": 301, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
