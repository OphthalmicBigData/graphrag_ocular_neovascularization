It serves as a site for hematopoiesis, the process of creating red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.  However, bone marrow can also be a breeding ground for tumor cells, making it a potential target for cancer development.  Specifically, bone marrow is where angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels) and gap formation occur, which are essential processes in tissue repair and regeneration.  It's also the source of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), mesenchymal stem cells, and cells involved in multiple myeloma (MM). Notably, bone marrow is a key location for studying diseases like chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) as it serves as the site where the disease progresses. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743238618, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 160, "prompt_tokens": 227, "total_tokens": 387, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
