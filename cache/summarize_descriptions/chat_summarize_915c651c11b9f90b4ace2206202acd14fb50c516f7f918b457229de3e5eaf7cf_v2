It plays a significant role in cell growth, development, and angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels). HIF-1α regulates gene expression and angiogenesis, contributing to both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions like tumor growth and inflammation.  It's also implicated in early vasculogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels during embryonic development.  HIF-1α is targeted by microRNA miR-376c-3p and regulates cellular response to hypoxia through various mechanisms. It is a key player in both physiological and pathological angiogenesis, making it a significant target for research and therapeutic interventions. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743087898, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 148, "prompt_tokens": 338, "total_tokens": 486, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
