It works by using light waves to create cross-sectional images of the eye, allowing for detailed visualization of tissue layers. OCT-angiography modality is a specific application of OCT that uses near-infrared light to visualize blood vessels in the eye.  OCT is also used to measure CNV volume and study the retina. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743087930, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 102, "prompt_tokens": 243, "total_tokens": 345, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
