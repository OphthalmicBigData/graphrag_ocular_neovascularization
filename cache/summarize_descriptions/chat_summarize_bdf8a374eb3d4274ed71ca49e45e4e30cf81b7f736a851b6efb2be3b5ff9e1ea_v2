This environment plays a crucial role in tumor growth, progression, and response to therapy.  It includes the area where cancer cells interact with other cells, as well as the interactions between cancer cells and the body's immune system. The TME is characterized by its intricate network of cell-cell communication and influences how the tumor interacts with the surrounding tissue and the body's immune system. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743303530, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 110, "prompt_tokens": 320, "total_tokens": 430, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
