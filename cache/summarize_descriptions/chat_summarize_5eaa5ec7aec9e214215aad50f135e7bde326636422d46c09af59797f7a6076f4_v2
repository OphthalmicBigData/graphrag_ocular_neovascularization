They are involved in various physiological processes, including blood vessel formation, maintenance, wound healing, and tumor growth. Endothelial cells form the innermost layer of blood vessels and contribute to the circulatory system by regulating blood flow and facilitating nutrient exchange. They are also studied for their role in angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation.  Endothelial cells have been investigated in various contexts, including the tumor microenvironment, breast tumors, and the inner lining of blood vessels in mice. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743345214, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 126, "prompt_tokens": 359, "total_tokens": 485, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
