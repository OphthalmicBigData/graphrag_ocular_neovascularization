It involves detecting proteins in a sample using antibodies, which bind specifically to the target protein. This method can be used to quantify protein levels, identify specific proteins, and study protein interactions. Western blotting is also used to detect gene expression levels by analyzing changes in mRNA abundance.  It is considered a valuable tool for various applications, including research on angiogenesis and bone formation (angio- and osteo-specific markers). \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743182529, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 100, "prompt_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 301, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
