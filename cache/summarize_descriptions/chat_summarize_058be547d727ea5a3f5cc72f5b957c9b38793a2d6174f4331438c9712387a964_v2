Studies have shown that miR-143 limits endothelial cell-matrix adhesion, thereby suppressing the development of retinal neovascularization.  Furthermore, research has demonstrated that miR-143 mimics effectively ameliorate retinal neovascularization in animal models of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR), a model for studying age-related macular degeneration.  This suggests that miR-143 may be a potential therapeutic target for treating retinal neovascularization. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743141969, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 115, "prompt_tokens": 203, "total_tokens": 318, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
