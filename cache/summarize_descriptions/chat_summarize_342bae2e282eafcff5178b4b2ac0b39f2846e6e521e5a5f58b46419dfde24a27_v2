It serves as an important tool for studying a wide range of biological processes, including implantation studies, wound healing, and the development of chondral bone. MICE are also employed in numerous studies investigating the effects of specific substances on conditions like osteoporosis, specifically focusing on the impact of SAR (presumably referring to Systemic Anti-Rheumatic) on bone health.  In addition, MICE have been utilized in research related to the study of bone development and the effects of various factors on it. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743343493, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 121, "prompt_tokens": 204, "total_tokens": 325, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
