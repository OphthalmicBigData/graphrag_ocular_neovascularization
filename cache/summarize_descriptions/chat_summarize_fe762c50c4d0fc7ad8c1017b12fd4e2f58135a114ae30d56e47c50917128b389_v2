It plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth and metabolism.  \n\nWhen activated, the **MTOR** cascade initiates a series of events that ultimately lead to increased protein synthesis and cell proliferation. This process is particularly important for endothelial cells, where it contributes to angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels). \n\nIt's also worth noting that **MTOR** can be damaging to cells when its activity is dysregulated or uncontrolled.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743303581, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 123, "prompt_tokens": 284, "total_tokens": 407, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
