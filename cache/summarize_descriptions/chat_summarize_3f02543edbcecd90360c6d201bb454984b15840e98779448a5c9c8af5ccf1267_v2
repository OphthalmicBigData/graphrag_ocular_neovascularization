This provides insights into various biological processes. RT-PCR can be applied to study cardiac remodelling or analyze gene expression in various biological samples.  It can also be used to detect the expression levels of specific mRNAs, such as VEGFA, IGF1, and ANGPT2, helping researchers identify regulatory mechanisms related to these genes by examining RNA molecules within cells.
