It serves as an important tool for studying tumor angiogenesis, gene expression, and protein function.  Researchers utilize zebrafish to investigate the development of heart regeneration, transgenesis studies, and other biological processes. The species' embryos are particularly valuable for research due to their transparency, allowing for easy observation of internal structures and developmental stages. Zebrafish are also used in research to study proteins like eif4ebp3l. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743183417, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 101, "prompt_tokens": 228, "total_tokens": 329, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
