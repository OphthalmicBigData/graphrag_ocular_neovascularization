It refers to the duration of time during which patients experience no new disease progression, measured from the start of treatment or diagnosis.  \n\nThere are several ways to understand PFS: \n\n* **Progression-free survival analysis:** This involves analyzing data to determine how long patients remain free from disease progression after starting treatment.\n* **Progression-free survival benefit:** This refers to the actual improvement in patient outcomes, such as longer time without disease progression, achieved by a specific treatment or intervention.\n* **Progression-free survival time:**  This is the specific duration of time during which patients experience no new disease progression. \n\n\nUnderstanding PFS is essential for evaluating the effectiveness and impact of treatments on patient survival and quality of life. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743141854, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 171, "prompt_tokens": 166, "total_tokens": 337, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
