These cells are commonly employed for modeling oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R), studying the development of new blood vessels (angiogenesis), and investigating wound healing processes. They are also utilized as a control group in research related to hemangioma endothelial cells. HUVECs are derived from the umbilical vein, making them readily accessible for scientific investigation.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743255608, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 114, "prompt_tokens": 292, "total_tokens": 406, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
