Specifically, CS treatment has been found to induce migration in ADSCs and reduce oxidative stress levels within these cells. Additionally, CS-stimulated ADSCs have demonstrated enhanced migratory and angiogenic capacities when tested on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Furthermore, studies using a full-thickness skin defect mouse model have shown that CS-stimulated ADSCs improve wound healing outcomes.  Overall, the research suggests that CS may be a promising therapeutic agent for treating wounds due to its ability to regulate and enhance the regenerative potential of ADSCs. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743238758, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 143, "prompt_tokens": 202, "total_tokens": 345, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
