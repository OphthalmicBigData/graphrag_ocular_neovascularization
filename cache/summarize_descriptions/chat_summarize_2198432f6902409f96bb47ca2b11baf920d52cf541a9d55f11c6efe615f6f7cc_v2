They play a crucial role in various physiological processes, including **angiogenesis**, the formation of new blood vessels, and **blood vessel formation and repair**.  These cells are essential for tissue regeneration and wound healing, as they contribute to the development and maintenance of healthy blood vessels. Endothelial cells also form filopodia projections, which help them interact with their surroundings and participate in angiogenesis. They are vital for bone healing, as they play a role in the process by lining the inner surface of blood vessels.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743158613, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 123, "prompt_tokens": 313, "total_tokens": 436, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
