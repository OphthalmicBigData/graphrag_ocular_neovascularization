Specifically, it involves conducting experiments on living subjects (animals or humans) to investigate the biological processes and responses related to a specific molecule or treatment. In this context, \"IN VIVO\" experiments were conducted to study the effects of 4AAQB on angiogenesis potential of scaffolds. This method allows researchers to observe real-time physiological changes in response to the tested molecules, providing valuable insights into their mechanisms of action and potential therapeutic applications.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743087921, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 111, "prompt_tokens": 174, "total_tokens": 285, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
