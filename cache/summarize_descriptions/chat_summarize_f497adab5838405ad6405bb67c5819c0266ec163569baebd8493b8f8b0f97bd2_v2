These cells are derived from human umbilical veins and play a vital role in blood vessel formation and function. They are commonly employed in various studies to investigate anti-angiogenesis effects, including those related to cancer treatment and vascular diseases. HUVECs are essential for understanding the mechanisms of blood vessel development and have been used in numerous research projects, including those investigating hypoxic conditions and angiogenesis. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743182501, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 110, "prompt_tokens": 381, "total_tokens": 491, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
