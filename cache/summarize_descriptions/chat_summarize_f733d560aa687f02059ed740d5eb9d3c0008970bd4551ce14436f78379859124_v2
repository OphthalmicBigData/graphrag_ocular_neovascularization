It is employed to observe and analyze lesions in various parts of the eye, including the retina, cornea, and optic nerve head. OCT can detect drusen, CNVs (choroidal neovascularization), and DME (diabetic macular edema).  It provides detailed images of retinal structure, allowing for precise analysis of these structures. The technique is also used to visualize corneal edema. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743255661, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 100, "prompt_tokens": 229, "total_tokens": 329, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
