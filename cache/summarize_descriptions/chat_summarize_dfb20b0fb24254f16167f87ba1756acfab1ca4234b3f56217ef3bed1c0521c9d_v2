It can be caused by various factors, including genetic changes and laser injury. CNV is often associated with high myopia and can lead to central vision loss.  It is a disease process that can progress over time. \n\nCNV is studied in the context of research on diseases like cancer and its impact on the retina. It is also a medical finding, often observed as a result of laser injury or other factors affecting the choroid. CNV can be induced in animal models using an argon laser, such as in C57BL6 mice. \n\nCNV is a type of neovascularization in the eye and can lead to complications like lacquer cracks and patchy chorioretinal atrophy. It is also linked to fibrosis-related conditions and genetic variation, often observed in cells.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743255587, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 191, "prompt_tokens": 519, "total_tokens": 710, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
