This process can be detected using SS-OCTA imaging and is often associated with age-related macular degeneration.  It can lead to vision loss due to its role in causing blindness or visual impairment. CNV is a complication observed in individuals with pathological myopia and can also be a rare occurrence in those with choroideremia. The condition involves immune cell infiltration, leading to the formation of new blood vessels that can cause significant damage to the eye's macula. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743255618, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 132, "prompt_tokens": 330, "total_tokens": 462, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
