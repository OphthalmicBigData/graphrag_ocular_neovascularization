It acts as a receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), binding to it to initiate downstream signaling pathways involved in blood vessel formation and repair.  VEGFR2 is implicated in both angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation, and inflammation. This protein is also a target for the chemical compound CPD-002, which has shown potential as a treatment for peripheral arterial diseases. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743303508, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 117, "prompt_tokens": 307, "total_tokens": 424, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
