It serves as an invaluable animal model for studying various diseases and biological processes, including diabetic retinopathy, hind limb ischemia, inflammation, ischemic diseases, wound healing, angiogenesis, tumor growth, vessel remodeling, and more.  Mice are particularly useful for investigating the role of NF-κB in pulmonary vascular development and corneal neovascularization. They are also used to study the effects of various treatments on bone healing, as well as the formation of CNV (choroidal neovascularization).  The mouse model is a common tool in research across diverse fields, allowing scientists to gain insights into disease mechanisms and develop potential therapies. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743238566, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 147, "prompt_tokens": 344, "total_tokens": 491, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
