They contribute to the formation and maintenance of blood vessel networks and are essential for blood vessel development and formation as part of the body's circulatory system. Endothelial cells are involved in various physiological processes, including those influenced by microRNA-143 (miR-143), and are particularly important for angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels, which is essential for blood vessel function and repair.  Endothelial cell activity is regulated by proteins like FGD5, and their responses to ischemia/reperfusion injury can be studied using the OGD-SD model.
