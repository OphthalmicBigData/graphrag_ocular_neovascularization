These cells are found within the walls of blood vessels throughout the body, including those in the brain, lungs, and retina.  They are essential for blood vessel formation, maintenance, and angiogenesis, a process where new blood vessels form. Endothelial cells are also involved in tumor growth and are studied for their role in cardiovascular disease mechanisms. They are particularly important in research investigating anti-angiogenic potential, which aims to inhibit the formation of new blood vessels.  Endothelial cells line the inner surface of blood vessels and contribute significantly to blood vessel structure and function. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743238544, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 148, "prompt_tokens": 383, "total_tokens": 531, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
