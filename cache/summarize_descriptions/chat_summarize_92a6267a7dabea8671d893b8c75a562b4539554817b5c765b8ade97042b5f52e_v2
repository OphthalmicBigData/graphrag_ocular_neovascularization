They are essential for angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels. These cells line the inner surface of blood vessels, including those within the heart, and play a crucial role in transporting liquids, nutrients, molecules, and cells throughout the body. Endothelial cells also contribute to skin aging by forming the inner lining of blood vessels.  They are a key focus of research due to their involvement in angiogenesis, cancer progression, and other physiological processes. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743238524, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 116, "prompt_tokens": 350, "total_tokens": 466, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
