It involves abnormal growth of blood vessels in the retina, leading to vision loss.  This can be detected by OCT images and observed as CNV patterns within the retina.  CNV can also refer to a specific location or lesion in the brain, often associated with **Central Vein Occlusion**, where blood flow to the eye is blocked, causing vision loss. \n\n**Genetic variation** can contribute to CNV, leading to vision loss. The condition can be further categorized as **Corneal Neovascularization (CNV)**, a disease of the eye characterized by abnormal blood vessel growth.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743255648, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 143, "prompt_tokens": 333, "total_tokens": 476, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
