It can be employed to measure type I collagen levels, observe the expression of proteins related to proliferation and angiogenesis in PDX tissue, investigate mechanisms of disease, study metastatic tumors, and explore the presence of specific proteins in tissue samples.  IHC is also used to study angiogenesis, a process involving the formation of new blood vessels. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743158745, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 94, "prompt_tokens": 232, "total_tokens": 326, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
