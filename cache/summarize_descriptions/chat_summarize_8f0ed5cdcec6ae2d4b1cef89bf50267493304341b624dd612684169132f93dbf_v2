They are involved in **tumor angiogenesis**, the formation of new blood vessels that support tumor growth.  These **blood vessels** are also studied for their relationship to **tissue stiffness**.  Specifically, researchers investigate how **blood vessel** properties influence the overall rigidity of tissues.  Furthermore, **blood vessels** are essential for **angiogenesis**, the process by which new blood vessels form in response to tissue needs.  They are particularly important in wound healing and regeneration, where they contribute to the formation of new **blood vessels**.  The presence of **Connexins** within certain **blood vessels** is also a subject of study. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743089689, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 156, "prompt_tokens": 255, "total_tokens": 411, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
