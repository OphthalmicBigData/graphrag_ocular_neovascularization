It is involved in both normal physiological processes like wound healing and tumor growth.  VEGF promotes angiogenesis by stimulating the formation of new blood vessels. Overaccumulation of VEGF can lead to diabetic retinopathy. \n\nThe **VEGF** pathway is activated after brain lesions and plays a role in various biological functions, including blood vessel formation and tumor growth. It is also a marker of tumor angiogenesis and has been studied extensively for its potential therapeutic applications.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743182489, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 120, "prompt_tokens": 466, "total_tokens": 586, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
