Specifically, GPNMB acts as an inhibitor of angiogenesis, meaning it helps to prevent the growth of new blood vessels. This protein is also involved in anti-migrative and anti-angiogenic roles, suggesting it may influence cell migration and vessel development. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743158862, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 85, "prompt_tokens": 178, "total_tokens": 263, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
