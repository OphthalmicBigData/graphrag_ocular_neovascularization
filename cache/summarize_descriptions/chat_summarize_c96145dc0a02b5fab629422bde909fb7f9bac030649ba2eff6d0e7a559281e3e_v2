It involves detecting specific proteins within a sample, allowing researchers to determine their presence and quantify their levels.  This technique can be applied to various applications, including studying protein expression patterns in wounds and assessing protein levels in biological samples. Western blot analysis is a widely used tool for studying protein expression and modification. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743141752, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 78, "prompt_tokens": 218, "total_tokens": 296, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
