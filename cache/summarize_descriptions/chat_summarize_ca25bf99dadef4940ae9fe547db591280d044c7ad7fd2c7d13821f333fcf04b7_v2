It is primarily known for its involvement in **mitophagy**, the process of removing damaged mitochondria, and **angiogenesis**, the formation of new blood vessels. SIRT3 acts as a regulator of mitophagy, influencing the degradation and recycling of dysfunctional mitochondria.  Furthermore, it exhibits neuroprotective properties by modulating cellular processes related to neuronal survival and function. Notably, SIRT3 is an enzyme that deacetylates proteins, impacting their activity and regulation. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743255682, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 111, "prompt_tokens": 202, "total_tokens": 313, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
