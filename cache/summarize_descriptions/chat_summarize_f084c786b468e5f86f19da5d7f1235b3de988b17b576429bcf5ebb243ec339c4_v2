It acts as a proangiogenic mediator, promoting the formation of new blood vessels through angiogenesis. VEGF also contributes to cell growth and development by regulating cell signaling pathways.  It's involved in bone regeneration, osteogenesis, and blood clotting. Additionally, VEGF is essential for vascular endothelial growth and development, making it a key player in processes like wound healing and tissue repair. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743255595, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 102, "prompt_tokens": 289, "total_tokens": 391, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
