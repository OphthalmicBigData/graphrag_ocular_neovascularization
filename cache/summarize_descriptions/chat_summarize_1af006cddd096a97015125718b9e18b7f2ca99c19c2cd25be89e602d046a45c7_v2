They are found in the lining of blood vessels, forming the inner layer known as endothelium. These cells play a crucial role in various physiological processes, including angiogenesis (formation and repair of blood vessels), blood flow regulation, wound healing, and response to hypoxia (low oxygen levels). \\n\\nEndothelial cells are involved in the process of angiogenesis, where they form new blood vessels. They are also studied in the context of angiogenesis, particularly in spheroid sprouting assays.  They are derived from human stem cells and contribute significantly to blood vessel formation and maintenance. Endothelial cells line blood vessels and play a role in blood flow regulation. \\n\", \"**Endothelial cells**, found within blood vessels, are essential cells that line the inner surface of blood vessels.
