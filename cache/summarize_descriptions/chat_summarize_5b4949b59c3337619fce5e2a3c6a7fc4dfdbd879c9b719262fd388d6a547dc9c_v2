This model replicates the development of retinal neovascularization and angiogenesis, which are key processes involved in diseases like retinopathy.  Specifically, OIR models involve exposing animal eyes to high levels of oxygen, mimicking conditions that can lead to retinal damage and vascular abnormalities. The resulting changes in the retina provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying these diseases, including the development of new treatments for retinal disorders. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743343481, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 106, "prompt_tokens": 183, "total_tokens": 289, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
