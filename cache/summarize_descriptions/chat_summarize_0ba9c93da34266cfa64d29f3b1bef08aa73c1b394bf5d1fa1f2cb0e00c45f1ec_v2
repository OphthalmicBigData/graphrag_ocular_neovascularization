It inhibits **EMT (epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition)** and **angiogenesis**, the processes involved in tumor growth and metastasis.  Furthermore, PAEONIFLORIN has been shown to activate **autophagy**, a cellular process that degrades damaged components. This compound is also known for its anti-angiogenic properties, meaning it can inhibit blood vessel formation.  It is an active ingredient found in traditional Chinese medicine and is extracted from the root of the **Radix Paeoniae** plant. Notably, PAEONIFLORIN has demonstrated potential as an anti-cancer agent. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743158737, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 144, "prompt_tokens": 205, "total_tokens": 349, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
