It consists of subjects or patients who do not receive any particular treatment or intervention, acting as a reference point against which the effects of the experimental group can be measured. This allows researchers to assess the impact of the intervention by comparing the results of the control group with those of the experimental group. The **CONTROL GROUP** is crucial for understanding the true effect of any intervention and ensuring that observed changes are not simply due to chance or other factors.  It can be composed of subjects who have not been subjected to specific treatments, such as mice not subjected to swimming (exercise) or patients without a specific treatment protocol, or those with conditions like asthma. \\n\", \"The **Control Group** is a crucial element in various scientific experiments and studies.
