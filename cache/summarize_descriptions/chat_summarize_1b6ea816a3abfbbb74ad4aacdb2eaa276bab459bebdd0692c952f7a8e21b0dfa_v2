It is involved in both **cell growth** and **HIF1AN/HIF-1α/VEGFA signaling pathway**.  Studies have shown that VEGFA expression is increased under high glucose conditions, suggesting its involvement in various physiological processes like wound healing.  It has been identified as a protein that promotes angiogenesis and blood vessel formation. Additionally, VEGFA is negatively correlated with **ERRγ** expression. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743287008, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 126, "prompt_tokens": 335, "total_tokens": 461, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
