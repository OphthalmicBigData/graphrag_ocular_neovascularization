It encompasses various cell types, including immune cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and pericytes, as well as extracellular matrix components like collagen and hyaluronic acid. These components interact with each other in intricate ways, shaping the tumor's behavior and influencing its interaction with the surrounding tissue. \n\nThe TME is characterized by a network of **relationships** that impact tumor growth and progression.  For example, immune cells within the TME can either suppress or promote tumor growth depending on their specific interactions with tumor cells and other components of the environment.  Understanding these complex relationships is crucial for developing effective cancer therapies. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743088115, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 158, "prompt_tokens": 157, "total_tokens": 315, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
