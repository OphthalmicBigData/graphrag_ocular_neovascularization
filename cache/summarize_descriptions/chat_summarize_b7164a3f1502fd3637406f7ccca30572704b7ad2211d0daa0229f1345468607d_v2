It is primarily known for its involvement in **angiogenesis**, the formation of new blood vessels, and **cell growth**. VEGF also contributes to **inflammation** and **tumor development**.  \n\nThis protein belongs to the **Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor superfamily** and regulates vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, and lymphangiogenesis. It is a key player in the **VEGF signaling pathway**, which influences cell proliferation and survival. \n\nFurthermore, VEGF has been extensively studied for its effects on **tumor development**.  It promotes angiogenesis, allowing tumors to grow by creating new blood vessels that supply them with nutrients and oxygen. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743216832, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 150, "prompt_tokens": 322, "total_tokens": 472, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
