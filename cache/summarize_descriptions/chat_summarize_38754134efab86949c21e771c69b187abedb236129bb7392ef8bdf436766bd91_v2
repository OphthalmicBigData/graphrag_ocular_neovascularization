It can be employed to quantify capillary density, study T and CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells, and investigate the immune system's role in various diseases like multiple myeloma (MM).  IHC allows researchers to identify specific cells and proteins within tissues, providing insights into cell proliferation, vascular density, and the presence of specific proteins. It is a valuable tool for studying both cells and tissues, offering detailed information about their composition and function. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743287036, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 109, "prompt_tokens": 256, "total_tokens": 365, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
