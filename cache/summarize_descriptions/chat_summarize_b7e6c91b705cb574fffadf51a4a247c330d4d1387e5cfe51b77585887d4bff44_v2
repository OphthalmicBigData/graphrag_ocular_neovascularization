It encompasses a lack of oxygen supply to tissues and cells, resulting in tissue damage or dysfunction. Hypoxia can induce angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, as a response to the reduced oxygen availability. In certain contexts, such as renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), hypoxia has been linked to tumor growth promotion. The presence of hypoxia was observed in specific tissues, like those found in the study on SBVM (likely referring to a specific research model or context).  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743303510, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 121, "prompt_tokens": 244, "total_tokens": 365, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
