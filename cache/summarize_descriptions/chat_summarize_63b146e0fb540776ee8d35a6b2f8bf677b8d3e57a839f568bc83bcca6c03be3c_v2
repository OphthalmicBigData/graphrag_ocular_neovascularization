It is particularly important for the cellular response to hypoxia, meaning low oxygen levels. HIF1α functions as a transcription factor, influencing gene expression to adapt cells to hypoxic conditions.  It is stabilized by the LUBAC (Leucine-rich repeat containing protein 2) complex, which prevents its degradation under normal oxygen levels.  HIF1α's activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis in low-oxygen environments. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743287161, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 122, "prompt_tokens": 194, "total_tokens": 316, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
