This process can occur in various locations, including the eye, tumors, and even the brain after specific treatments like XST administration.  It plays a crucial role in wound healing and tissue engineering. \n\nSpecifically, neovascularization refers to abnormal blood vessel growth in the retina, often associated with conditions like diabetic retinopathy. It is also a key component of tumor development, where new blood vessels provide nutrients and oxygen for tumor growth. In the eye, neovascularization can manifest as abnormal blood vessel growth in the sub-lining or deep lining, leading to various ocular diseases. \n\nNeovascularization is a process that involves the formation of new blood vessels, often triggered by specific stimuli like injury or inflammation. It has therapeutic applications in wound healing and tissue engineering, where it can be harnessed to promote regeneration.  \n\n\n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743343541, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 188, "prompt_tokens": 366, "total_tokens": 554, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
