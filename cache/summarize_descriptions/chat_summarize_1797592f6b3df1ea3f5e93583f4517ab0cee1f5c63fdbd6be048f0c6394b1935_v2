It is a pro-angiogenic factor and a growth factor involved in both normal physiological processes and tumor growth. VEGF stimulates cell growth and survival, and its expression is regulated by various factors, including hypoxia-inducible factor-1 subunit alpha (HIF-1α). \\n\\nVEGF levels are influenced by different stimuli, such as sugar intake, and can be measured to assess angiogenesis. It has been found to be highly expressed in LCI rats, a model used for studying blood vessel formation. VEGF is also involved in the development of tumors, where it promotes tumor growth and angiogenesis.  \\n\\nThe protein's influence on angiogenesis is well-documented, with studies showing its involvement in various pathways, including the HIF-1α-Netrin-1-UNC5B/VEGF cascade. It acts as a growth factor directly promoting blood vessel formation and development. VEGF levels are often measured to assess corneal neovascularization and tumor recurrence.  \\n\\nFurthermore, VEGF is targeted by therapies like aflibercept, which inhibits its activity. While some descriptions mention VEGF's role in bone formation and cell growth, these aspects are less prominent compared to its primary roles in angiogenesis and vascular development. \\n\", \"The **VEGF** (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) is a protein that plays a crucial role in angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels.
