It encodes for a protein called PlGF, which is involved in angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels.  PlGF contributes to both physiological and pathological uterine angiogenesis, meaning it can be involved in healthy blood vessel growth as well as abnormal, potentially harmful, growth. This protein is secreted by embryonic stem cells (EnSCs) and has been utilized in research settings. PlGF also plays a role in inflammation and blood vessel growth, highlighting its diverse functions within the body. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743328350, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 121, "prompt_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 314, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
