This abnormal growth can be associated with angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels that supply the growing tumour with nutrients and oxygen.  The process is often characterized by the expansion of tumour cells, which can then spread to other parts of the body (metastasis). Tumour growth is influenced by various factors, including genetic mutations, environmental triggers, and the presence of antineoplastic agents. Notably, tumour growth is closely linked to angiogenesis, a process that creates hypoxic areas within the tumour, further impacting its development. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743185607, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 131, "prompt_tokens": 273, "total_tokens": 404, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
