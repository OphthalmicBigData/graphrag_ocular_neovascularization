It encompasses various components, including immune cells, stromal cells, blood vessels, and extracellular matrix, all interacting to create an environment conducive to tumor development.  This environment is characterized by angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, which fuels tumor growth and metastasis. The TME also influences the behavior of cancer stem cells (CSCs), a subset of tumor cells with self-renewal and differentiation capabilities.  The TME's influence on CSC activity highlights its importance in understanding and treating cancers. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743238526, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 130, "prompt_tokens": 235, "total_tokens": 365, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
