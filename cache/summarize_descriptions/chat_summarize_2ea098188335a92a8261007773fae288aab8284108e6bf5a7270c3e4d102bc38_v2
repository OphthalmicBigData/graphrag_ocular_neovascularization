It acts as a receptor for Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A (VEGFA), which promotes blood vessel formation and development.  VEGFR2 is involved in downstream signaling pathways related to VEGF, impacting tumor suppression and angiogenesis. This protein can be targeted by specific drugs like SU11248, highlighting its importance in various biological processes. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743287048, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 95, "prompt_tokens": 262, "total_tokens": 357, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
