It occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow on the back of the eye, leading to leakage and vision loss. CNV can cause cataracts and other eye diseases.  It's a complex condition that can be studied in labs using laser-induced techniques. The area of study for CNV is often referred to as the **choroid**, which is the layer beneath the retina.  CNV lesions were observed in the BA treated group, indicating its potential role in various eye diseases. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743343525, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 119, "prompt_tokens": 292, "total_tokens": 411, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
