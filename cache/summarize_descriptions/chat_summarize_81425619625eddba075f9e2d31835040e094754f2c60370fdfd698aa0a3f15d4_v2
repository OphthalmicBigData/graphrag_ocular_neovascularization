This tissue is widely used as a pre-clinical model for studying various aspects of tumor biology, including angiogenesis, antiangiogenesis, tumor growth, tumor metastasis, and drug efficacy.  The CAM serves as an in vivo platform for analyzing angiogenesis, allowing researchers to study the formation and development of new blood vessels within a living organism. It is particularly valuable for investigating the effects of drugs on angiogenesis, providing insights into potential therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743343547, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 122, "prompt_tokens": 286, "total_tokens": 408, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
