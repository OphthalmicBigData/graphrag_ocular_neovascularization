It is studied in both mouse models and rat models of the central nervous system. CNV can lead to reduced visual acuity and blindness in the elderly. The condition is often associated with other conditions like diabetic retinopathy and cystic fibrosis-related transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutations. It is a type of tissue damage that affects the retina, specifically the area where CpG-ODN is present.  CNV can be studied in various contexts, including the study of changes in the optic nerve and the central nervous system vision. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743087902, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 136, "prompt_tokens": 413, "total_tokens": 549, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
