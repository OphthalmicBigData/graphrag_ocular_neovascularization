Specifically, mice are commonly used as models in studies to investigate the effects of chemicals on the body and to explore the mechanisms behind diseases. These animals are particularly useful for research due to their genetic similarities with humans and their susceptibility to certain conditions. Mice are also frequently employed in the tMCAO model, a technique used to induce stroke-like damage in rodents.  Furthermore, mice have been utilized as subjects in studies examining gene expression changes (DEGs) and other biological processes. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743255673, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 114, "prompt_tokens": 207, "total_tokens": 321, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
