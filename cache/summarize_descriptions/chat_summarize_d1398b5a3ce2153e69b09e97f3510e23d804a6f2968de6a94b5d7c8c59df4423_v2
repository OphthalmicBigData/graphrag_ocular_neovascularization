It's a multimodal imaging method that can detect CNV (choroidal neovascularization), which is the abnormal growth of blood vessels in the eye. OCT-A helps confirm diagnoses of active type 2 CNV by providing detailed images of the retina and choroid.  It is often used to study the progression of CNV and its impact on vision.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743089690, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 110, "prompt_tokens": 247, "total_tokens": 357, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
