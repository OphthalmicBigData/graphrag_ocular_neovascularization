These cells play crucial roles in blood vessel formation, growth, and development, including placental development. They line blood vessels and contribute to the production of nitric oxide. HUVECs are also utilized for various applications, such as:\n\n* **Research:** Studying angiogenesis, wound healing, and the effects of drugs like FOL-026.\n* **In vitro models:** Simulating the in vitro environment of SONFH cells and testing the effectiveness of SFMG coatings. \n* **HCC research:**  Used for studying hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\n* **H/R model:** Used in the H/R model to study blood vessel growth and function.\n\nFurthermore, these cells are found within the umbilical vein and can be used to promote blood vessel growth. They are a valuable tool for researchers investigating various biological processes. \n\n\n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743328212, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 197, "prompt_tokens": 328, "total_tokens": 525, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
