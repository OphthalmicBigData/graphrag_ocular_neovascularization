These **cells were taken up by hASC-Exos in vitro**, indicating their use in experimental settings. They have been employed in various analyses including transwell migration, tube formation, and wound healing studies.  Furthermore, HUVECs are a valuable resource for research applications due to their relevance to medical treatments and understanding human biology. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743287012, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 112, "prompt_tokens": 231, "total_tokens": 343, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
