It's also known as a growth factor and is involved in cell growth and development.  VEGF promotes angiogenesis by stimulating the formation of new blood vessels.  It is studied extensively in various contexts, including OSMF (Osteogenesis imperfecta) and the study of BRAF mutations, where its increased levels are observed. VEGF is an angiogenic factor that contributes to both blood vessel growth and development. It has also been linked to fibrosis, suggesting a potential role in tissue repair and scarring.  Furthermore, VEGF is a gene involved in angiogenesis regulation, highlighting its importance in vascular system development and function. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743287010, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 153, "prompt_tokens": 297, "total_tokens": 450, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
