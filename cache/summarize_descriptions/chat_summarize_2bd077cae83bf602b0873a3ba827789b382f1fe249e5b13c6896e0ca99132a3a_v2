It refers to abnormal growth of blood vessels in the choroid, a layer of tissue beneath the retina.  This condition can be observed through OCT-angiography and is associated with PM-CNV recurrence. Research on CNV focuses on its impact on the eye's health, particularly the effects of treatments like JP1.
