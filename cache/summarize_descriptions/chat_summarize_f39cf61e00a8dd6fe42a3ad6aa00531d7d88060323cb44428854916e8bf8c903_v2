It has also been employed to study retinal epithelial cells and the effects of DP2 on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Notably, ARPE-19 cells are frequently utilized in high glucose-induced retinal epithelial cell models to understand the impact of elevated glucose levels on eye health.  Overall, ARPE-19 cells serve as a valuable resource for various research endeavors related to cellular biology and ophthalmology. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743238678, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 117, "prompt_tokens": 199, "total_tokens": 316, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
