It's a **pro-angiogenic factor** meaning it promotes blood vessel formation, and its activity is essential for various physiological processes like wound healing and tissue repair.  \n\nVEGF belongs to a family of proteins known as **Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) family**. This protein family is also targeted by anti-angiogenic drugs used in cancer treatment. \n\nResearch on the effects of VEGF has been conducted using **mice**, and its expression levels have been studied in various animal models, including those with myocardial infarction (AMI).  It's a key molecule involved in cell signaling and is often analyzed using techniques like Western blot analysis.  VEGF is also used as a tool for studying angiogenesis and blood vessel formation. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743255613, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 180, "prompt_tokens": 350, "total_tokens": 530, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
