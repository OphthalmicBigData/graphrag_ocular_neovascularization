It plays a crucial role in the development of blood vessels, acting as both a **growth factor** that stimulates angiogenesis and a **regulator** of several physiological processes like placental development and NSCLC progression. \n\nSpecifically, VEGFA promotes angiogenesis by stimulating endothelial cells (HUVECs) to form new blood vessels. It is also known for its role in regulating the growth and development of blood vessels, making it an important target for research and therapeutic interventions related to vascular diseases and cancer.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743328257, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 127, "prompt_tokens": 264, "total_tokens": 391, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
