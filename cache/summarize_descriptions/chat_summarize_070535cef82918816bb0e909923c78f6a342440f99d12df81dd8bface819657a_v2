It acts as an integral component of the cell signaling pathway and plays a crucial role in endothelial cell functions and angiogenesis.  This protein has been identified as a potential early marker for angiogenesis, indicating its involvement in the development and progression of blood vessel formation. Notably, CD44 is expressed in the border zone of the infarcted heart, highlighting its relevance to cardiovascular health and disease. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743182577, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 98, "prompt_tokens": 197, "total_tokens": 295, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
