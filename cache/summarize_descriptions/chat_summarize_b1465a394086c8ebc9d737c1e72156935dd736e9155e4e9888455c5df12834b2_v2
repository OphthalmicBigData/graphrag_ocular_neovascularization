It is involved in the development of various diseases and promotes angiogenesis by stimulating the growth of new blood vessels. VEGF is secreted by cells and acts as a growth factor, contributing to vasculogenesis, the process of developing blood vessels from stem cells. It has been extensively studied for its potential use in bone regeneration research due to its ability to promote angiogenesis.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743182549, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 111, "prompt_tokens": 295, "total_tokens": 406, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
