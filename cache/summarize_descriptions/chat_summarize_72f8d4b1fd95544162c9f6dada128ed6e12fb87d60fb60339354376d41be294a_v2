It involves staining cells with fluorescent antibodies that bind specifically to target molecules, allowing researchers to observe the location and distribution of these proteins under a microscope.

Immunofluorescence can be applied to study various biological processes such as angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels), neurogenesis (development of new neurons), wound healing, and other biological processes.
