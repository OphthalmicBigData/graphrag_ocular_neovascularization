It is the body's natural response to injury or infection, often triggered by tissue damage.  Inflammation can be caused by various factors, including immune system responses to injury or illness. \n\nWhile inflammation is a key factor in many physiological processes, it can also contribute to complications such as resistance to anti-VEGF drugs and ocular neovascularization. The process of inflammation plays a significant role in the development of the DU mouse model and eye development.  Inflammation is involved in both the immune response to injury or infection and the body's natural response to injury or infection, often causing pain and swelling. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743303481, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 144, "prompt_tokens": 293, "total_tokens": 437, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
