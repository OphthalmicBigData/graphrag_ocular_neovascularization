This condition can lead to blindness and is a leading cause of vision loss.  It is also a potential target for new drugs and treatments, as it can be a major cause of blindness. RNV is often described as a type of retinal pathology, and its development can result in various complications, including retinal detachment. The process of forming new blood vessels in the retina is known as neovascularization, and this process has been identified as a potential target for new drugs aimed at treating vision loss caused by RNV. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743216884, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 130, "prompt_tokens": 242, "total_tokens": 372, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
