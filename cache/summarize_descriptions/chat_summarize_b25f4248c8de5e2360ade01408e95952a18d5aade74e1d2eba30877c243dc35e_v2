This crucial process plays a vital role in various physiological functions, including development, wound repair, tissue perfusion, and tumor growth.  It is essential for organ morphogenesis and growth during development, as well as for processes like bone remodeling and breast cancer progression. \n\nAngiogenesis can be triggered by several factors, including transplantation, injury, or disease. It involves the expansion of existing blood vessels or the formation of new ones from pre-existing vasculature.  The process is also implicated in various diseases, with over 70 human diseases exhibiting dysregulated angiogenesis. \n\nFor example, angiogenesis plays a role in wound healing, myocardial infarction recovery, and tumor growth. In the context of tissue repair, it facilitates the formation of new blood vessels to support cell growth and regeneration.  However, its involvement in tumor growth is complex, as it can both promote and hinder tumor development depending on the specific tumor type and microenvironment. \n\nThe process of angiogenesis has been extensively studied, with research focusing on understanding its mechanisms and potential therapeutic applications. For instance, researchers have investigated how to manipulate angiogenesis for wound healing or cancer treatment.  \n\n\n**Key points:**\n* **Definition:** Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels.\n* **Importance:** Essential for development, wound repair, tissue perfusion, tumor growth, bone remodeling, and more. \n* **Mechanism:** Involves expansion of existing vessels or formation of new ones from pre-existing vasculature.\n* **Dysregulation:** Over 70 human diseases exhibit dysregulated angiogenesis.\n* **Applications:** Research focuses on understanding and manipulating angiogenesis for therapeutic purposes in various conditions. \n\n\n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743087885, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 359, "prompt_tokens": 835, "total_tokens": 1194, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
