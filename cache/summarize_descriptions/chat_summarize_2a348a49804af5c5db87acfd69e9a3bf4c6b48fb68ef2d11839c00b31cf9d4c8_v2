This growth disrupts corneal transparency, leading to visual impairment and potentially blindness.  It can be a global threat to human health, as it can cause significant vision loss. The condition is often associated with angiogenesis, a process of abnormal blood vessel formation.  Corneal neovascularization can be assessed using the corneal neovascularization assay, which measures the extent of new blood vessel growth on the cornea. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743255651, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 105, "prompt_tokens": 249, "total_tokens": 354, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
