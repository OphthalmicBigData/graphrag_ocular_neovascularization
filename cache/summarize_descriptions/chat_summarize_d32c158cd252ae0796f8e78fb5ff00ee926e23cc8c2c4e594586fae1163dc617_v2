It plays a role in both the immune response and tissue repair processes.  TNF-α induces CD40 upregulation in HRMECs and Müller cells, contributing to inflammatory responses.  It's also known as a **signaling molecule** used in research studies. TNF-α is classified as a type of **inflammatory cytokine**, promoting angiogenesis in OSCC cells. It can stimulate the growth of tumor cells and its levels are measured during treatment. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743287034, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 115, "prompt_tokens": 269, "total_tokens": 384, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
