It acts as a **growth factor** and a **signaling molecule** involved in cell growth, development, and survival.  VEGFA is abnormally overexpressed in **non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)** cells resistant to chemotherapy (DDP). This overexpression contributes to tumor progression and chemoresistance. \n\nVEGFA is also associated with inflammation and angiogenesis. It promotes the growth of new blood vessels, which can contribute to tumor growth and metastasis.  It's a key player in **cell signaling** pathways related to angiogenesis.  Furthermore, VEGFA is secreted by breast cancer cells after activation of the **Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1 (FGFR1)** pathway.\n\nVEGFA is also a company name and a gene that regulates angiogenesis. It is often studied for its potential as a therapeutic target in various cancers, including NSCLC.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743158684, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 213, "prompt_tokens": 353, "total_tokens": 566, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
