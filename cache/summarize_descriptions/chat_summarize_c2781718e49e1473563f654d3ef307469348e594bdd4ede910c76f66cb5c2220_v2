It acts as a master regulator of this process and promotes both blood vessel growth and repair.  VEGF is also a natural ligand for the **VEGFR2** receptor, which plays a key role in mediating its effects on blood vessels.  While VEGF itself can be used to treat conditions like **central venous insufficiency (CNV)**, it's important to note that certain inhibitors of VEGF have been developed and are used for this purpose. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743087994, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 120, "prompt_tokens": 204, "total_tokens": 324, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
