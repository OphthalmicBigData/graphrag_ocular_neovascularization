This process, essential for normal development, tissue repair, and wound healing, also plays a crucial role in tumor growth and metastasis. Angiogenesis involves the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones or by sprouting new vessels from existing ones. It is a key hallmark of tumors and is targeted by therapies aimed at inhibiting its progression.  Angiogenesis is regulated by various factors, including the circadian clock, and can be inhibited by certain substances like saponins. \\n\\nThe process of angiogenesis is studied extensively in research, particularly in the context of VCE-005.1, a potential treatment for cancer. It is also a significant factor in cardiovascular disease (CVD) development and vascular pathologies.  Angiogenesis is essential for tissue growth and repair, including wound healing, and plays a vital role in tumor growth and metastasis. \\n\", \"Angiogenesis is a crucial biological process that involves the formation of new blood vessels from existing ones.
