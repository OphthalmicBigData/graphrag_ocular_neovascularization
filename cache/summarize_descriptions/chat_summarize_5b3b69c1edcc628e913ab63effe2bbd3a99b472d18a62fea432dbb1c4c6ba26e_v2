It functions as an inhibitor of retinal apoptosis, meaning it helps prevent the programmed death of retinal cells.  Furthermore, research has shown that MIR-184 is upregulated in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of vision loss. This suggests that MIR-184 may be involved in the development and progression of AMD. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743158661, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 90, "prompt_tokens": 173, "total_tokens": 263, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
