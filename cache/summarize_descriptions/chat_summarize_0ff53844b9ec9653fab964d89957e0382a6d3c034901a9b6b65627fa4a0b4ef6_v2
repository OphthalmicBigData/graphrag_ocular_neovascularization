They are found in the umbilical vein and play a role in blood vessel formation, growth, and placental development. HUVECs line blood vessels and contribute to angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation. They can be used for various research applications, including studying wound healing, testing the effectiveness of SFMG coatings, simulating the in vitro environment of SONFH cells, and investigating the effects of FOL-026.  HUVECs are also commonly used in studies related to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and have been employed in the H/R model for research purposes. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743328757, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 151, "prompt_tokens": 323, "total_tokens": 474, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
