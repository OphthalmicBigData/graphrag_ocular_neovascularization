It's defined by a p-value, which represents the probability of observing the obtained results if the null hypothesis were true. A p-value less than 0.05 (commonly referred to as a significance level) indicates that the observed results are statistically significant and likely not due to random chance. This p-value is crucial in determining whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis, which forms the basis of statistical inference.  The P statistic itself is often used alongside probability values to assess the likelihood of observing data under specific conditions. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743088116, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 135, "prompt_tokens": 161, "total_tokens": 296, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
