It involves abnormal growth of blood vessels in the choroid, a layer of tissue beneath the retina.  This can lead to vision loss and is often associated with genetic variations. CNV lesions are a type of genetic variation that can contribute to this condition. \n\nCNV research has been conducted on both human subjects and mouse models. The study groups used for research may include individuals with CNV or those who have undergone eye surgery, such as corneal nerve variation.  The areas of the eye compared in studies often involve the choroid and retina.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743216834, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 133, "prompt_tokens": 261, "total_tokens": 394, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
