It is primarily used to treat various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and has been approved for the treatment of central serous chorioretinopathy. Bevacizumab inhibits angiogenesis, which is the formation of new blood vessels, by targeting specific proteins involved in this process.  It can be used in clinical settings to starve tumors and inhibit their growth. \n\nWhile it's primarily known for its use in cancer treatment, Bevacizumab has also been studied for its potential in treating other conditions like MNV (multiple myeloma) and CNV (central nervous system). It is important to note that Bevacizumab can cause cardiovascular adverse events (AEs), which are most frequently reported. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743182629, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 169, "prompt_tokens": 255, "total_tokens": 424, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
