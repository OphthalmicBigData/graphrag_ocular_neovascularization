It involves separating proteins based on their molecular weight using gel electrophoresis, followed by transferring them to a membrane and then detecting specific proteins using antibodies. This technique can be applied to various biological samples, including cells like Y79 cells, and it's particularly useful for quantifying protein expression levels.  Western blotting is also used to validate the results of network pharmacology analysis and study the effects of factors such as PNS on protein expression. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743345217, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 110, "prompt_tokens": 234, "total_tokens": 344, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
