It is particularly useful in assessing areas of microvascular changes, such as those associated with multiple neovascularization (MNV).  OCTA utilizes light to create detailed images of blood vessels, allowing for the visualization of CNV areas. This technique is also employed to assess eye health and has been developed by the organization responsible for its creation. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743158755, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 100, "prompt_tokens": 199, "total_tokens": 299, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
