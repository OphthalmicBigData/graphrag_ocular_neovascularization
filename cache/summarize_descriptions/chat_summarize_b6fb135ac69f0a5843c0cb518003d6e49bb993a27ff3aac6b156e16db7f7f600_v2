It functions as an angiogenic factor, contributing to the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis).  In research investigating the antioxidant properties of garlic peel extract, CD31 expression levels were analyzed within tumor tissues. This analysis aimed to understand how garlic peel extract might influence the body's response to oxidative stress and potentially impact cancer progression.  Furthermore, CD31 is recognized as a protein involved in angiogenesis, highlighting its significance in blood vessel development. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743345240, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 119, "prompt_tokens": 183, "total_tokens": 302, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
