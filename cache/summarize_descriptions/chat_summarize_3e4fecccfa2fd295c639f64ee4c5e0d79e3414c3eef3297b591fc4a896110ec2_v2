This process, also known as tube formation, is influenced by microRNA-181b-5p and is being investigated in relation to embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).  It is a key subject of study in angiogenesis assays, which are used to measure the growth of new blood vessels. Tube formation can also be detected using specific techniques employed in experimental settings. This process plays a crucial role in various biological processes and is often utilized as a method for studying cell behavior and interactions within a controlled environment. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743141807, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 132, "prompt_tokens": 208, "total_tokens": 340, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
