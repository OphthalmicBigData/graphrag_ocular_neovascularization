They are distinct structures that play specific roles within the eye's structure and function. The external limiting membrane is a layer found on the outer surface of the retina, while the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) lies beneath the photoreceptor cells in the retina. Both structures are essential for proper vision. Notably, disruptions to these components have been observed in certain conditions like T3 MNV (a viral infection).  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743255832, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 106, "prompt_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 293, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
