It can be caused by various factors, including age-related macular degeneration and certain genetic changes that affect cell growth.  CNV is often treated with medications like TCZ. \n\n**Here's a breakdown of CNV:**\n\n* **Definition:** A condition where blood vessels grow abnormally in the retina.\n* **Causes:** Can be caused by age-related macular degeneration, genetic changes affecting cell growth, and other factors.\n* **Symptoms:** Vision problems, including blurred vision or loss of central vision. \n* **Treatment:** Medications like TCZ can help manage CNV.\n\n\nIt's important to note that CNV is a complex condition with various forms and causes.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743303496, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 173, "prompt_tokens": 258, "total_tokens": 431, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
