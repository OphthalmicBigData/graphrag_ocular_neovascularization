It plays a crucial role in cell signaling and tumor suppression, as well as regulating lung cancer progression. VEGFA acts as a growth factor that promotes angiogenesis and cell proliferation. It's also a target for RA treatment and is upregulated in certain studies.  VEGFA is a protein that can be targeted by miR-20b-5p. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743182512, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 112, "prompt_tokens": 341, "total_tokens": 453, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
