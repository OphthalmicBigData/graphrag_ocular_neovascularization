It is elevated in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, indicating its involvement in the disease's pathogenesis.  Furthermore, CXCL5 promotes tumor progression by stimulating proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and therapy resistance. This protein also participates in inflammation and wound healing, contributing to both immune responses and tissue repair. Notably, CXCL5 activates the CXCR2 receptor, leading to increased angiogenesis, a process crucial for tumor growth and metastasis.  Therefore, CXCL5 is a multifaceted molecule with implications for both health and disease. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743255713, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 125, "prompt_tokens": 215, "total_tokens": 340, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
