It acts as a growth factor that promotes angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis (formation of lymphatic vessels).  While VEGF-A gene expression levels were higher in tumor tissues compared to normal tissue, its concentration did not show significant differences between responders and non-responders.  VEGF-A is produced by cells in response to ILT4 and plays a crucial role in the development of new blood vessels. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743303520, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 112, "prompt_tokens": 272, "total_tokens": 384, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
