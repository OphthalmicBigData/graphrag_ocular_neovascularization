It belongs to the VEGFR family and acts as a receptor for both **VEGF** (vascular endothelial growth factor) and **PLGF** (pro-angiogenic ligand).  VEGFR2 is involved in blood vessel development and growth, vascular development, and tumor angiogenesis. This protein regulates angiogenesis by binding to VEGF and PLGF, triggering downstream signaling pathways that promote the formation of new blood vessels. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743182599, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 107, "prompt_tokens": 238, "total_tokens": 345, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
