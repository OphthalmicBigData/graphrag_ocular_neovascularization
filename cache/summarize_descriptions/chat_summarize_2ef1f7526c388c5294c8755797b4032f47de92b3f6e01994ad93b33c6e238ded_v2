This process helps identify the most important predictors while reducing complexity and potentially avoiding overfitting.  Another way to understand the **LASSO** is that it reduces the number of variables in an analysis by removing redundant ones. The method achieves this through regularization, which shrinks the coefficients of less significant variables towards zero, effectively reducing their impact on the model. This process helps improve the accuracy and interpretability of the resulting model by focusing on the most relevant features.  The **LASSO** is particularly useful for analyzing data related to angiogenesis, where it can be used to build an angiogenesis-related signature. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743288659, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 161, "prompt_tokens": 284, "total_tokens": 445, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
