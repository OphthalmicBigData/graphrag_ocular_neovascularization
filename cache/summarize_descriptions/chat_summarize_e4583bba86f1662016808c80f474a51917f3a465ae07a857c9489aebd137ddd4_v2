It measures protein expression levels by separating proteins based on their size using gel electrophoresis and then transferring them to a membrane.  Antibodies are then used to bind to the target proteins, allowing for their detection through various methods like chemiluminescence or fluorescence. This technique can be used to measure the levels of proteins such as phosphorylated (p)-AMPK, AMPK, KLF2, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and VEG.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743343480, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 109, "prompt_tokens": 234, "total_tokens": 343, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
