It plays a crucial role in the process of blood vessel formation (angiogenesis). ECs are often used as a target for anti-tumor activity research due to their involvement in tumor growth and metastasis. The **EC** entity has also been investigated as a potential drug target, with some molecules like VEGFR2 inhibitors showing promise in inhibiting angiogenesis.  The term \"ECs\" is frequently used to refer to this group of cells, and the text often refers to them as a research group or organization that investigates anti-angiogenic mechanisms. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743303537, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 137, "prompt_tokens": 217, "total_tokens": 354, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
