It acts as a signaling molecule that promotes endothelial cell migration and tube formation, contributing to the development of new blood vessels (angiogenesis).  Furthermore, IL-8 plays a role in tumor progression by promoting tumor growth and development.  It has been implicated in the progression of various cancers, acting as a protein involved in tumor biology.  IL-8 is secreted by As-T cells, which can activate other cells to further contribute to inflammation and tumor progression. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743141761, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 117, "prompt_tokens": 223, "total_tokens": 340, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
