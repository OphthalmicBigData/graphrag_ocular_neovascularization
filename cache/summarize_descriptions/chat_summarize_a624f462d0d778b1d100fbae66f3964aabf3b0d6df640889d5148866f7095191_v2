This growth can lead to vision loss and damage to central vision. CNV can occur after anti-VEGF therapy in some cases, making it a late-stage complication in Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD).  It is often difficult to diagnose with traditional imaging techniques like fluorescein angiography. \n\nCNV is considered an eye condition and is a significant pathological change associated with wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). It can be further categorized as a specific type of eye disease, impacting the central vision of the eye. The process of CNV involves abnormal vessel growth from the choroidal vasculature to the neurosensory retina. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743216889, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 166, "prompt_tokens": 338, "total_tokens": 504, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
