It is particularly useful for studying neovascularization, which refers to the formation of new blood vessels in the eye. OCTA uses light to create detailed images of the retina and its blood vessels, allowing researchers to measure vessel diameter and identify abnormalities like macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy.  It can also be used to detect nonexudative MNV (multifocal neuro-ocular vascular) by analyzing the retinal microvasculature. \\n\", \"The **OCTA** (Optical coherence tomography angiography) is a specialized imaging technique used to evaluate the eyes.
