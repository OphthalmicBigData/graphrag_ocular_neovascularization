It can occur in various organs, including the liver, where it's known as **chronic liver disease**.  This process involves replacing healthy tissue with scar tissue, leading to organ dysfunction. Fibrosis can manifest in different forms, such as **subcutaneous adipose tissue fibrosis**, which refers to the formation of scar tissue in fat cells. The condition is often described as a disease that causes scarring and can lead to various complications depending on the affected area. \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743255671, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 108, "prompt_tokens": 228, "total_tokens": 336, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
