It acts as a **receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)**, binding to it and triggering downstream signaling pathways involved in the formation of new blood vessels. VEGFR2 is also known as **Growth factor receptor 2** and **Protein involved in angiogenesis and tumor growth**, highlighting its significance in both physiological processes like wound healing and pathological conditions like cancer.  Research on VEGFR2 has been computationally intensive, leading to a deeper understanding of its structure and function.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743255643, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 125, "prompt_tokens": 269, "total_tokens": 394, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
