It's located at the back of the eye and is responsible for converting light into electrical signals that are sent to the brain for interpretation.  The retina contains specialized cells called photoreceptors that detect light, as well as other cells involved in processing visual information. \n\nThe **retina** is also affected by age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of vision loss. It's been studied extensively in models like the oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model to understand how diseases affect the eye and develop potential treatments.  Researchers have observed RNA nanoparticles being internalized within the **retina**, highlighting its role in cellular processes. Additionally, the **retina** is where blood vessels are located, and it's also a site of new microglia repopulation following injury or disease. \n\n\n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743303475, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 187, "prompt_tokens": 247, "total_tokens": 434, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
