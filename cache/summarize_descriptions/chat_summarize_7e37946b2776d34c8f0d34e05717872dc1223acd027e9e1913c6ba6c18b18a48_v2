It is characterized by damage to the **macula**, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp vision.  MNV can develop in the eye and is often associated with **AMD (Age-related Macular Degeneration)**, where it can lead to **exudation** in the macula. \n\nMNV can be detected by **Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA)**. It's a **measurable neurological condition**, meaning its severity and progression can be quantified.  The condition is often linked to **myopia** (nearsightedness) and can lead to **myopic macular neovascularization**. \n\nMNV is a significant medical condition, as it can cause **significant vision loss** and has been found to be statistically significant in certain populations. It's important to note that MNV can be **complicating factor** in the left eye, and its impact on vision can vary depending on individual cases.  \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743182533, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 222, "prompt_tokens": 362, "total_tokens": 584, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
