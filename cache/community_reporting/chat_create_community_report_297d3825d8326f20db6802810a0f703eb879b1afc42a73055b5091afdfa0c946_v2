It is a connective tissue that surrounds and supports various organs, muscles, and other structures within the body. \n\",3\n61,BLOOD VESSELS,\"Blood vessels are essential structures within the human body, playing a crucial role in transporting blood throughout the system.  They contribute significantly to the tumor microenvironment (TME), where they create a hypoxic environment due to their role in oxygen supply and waste removal. Blood vessels are involved in tumor growth and development, often infiltrating tumors themselves. These tubes carry blood from the heart to various parts of the body, including bone tissue.  They can be found both within the body's natural structures and as part of specific research models like lung cancer cell lines. \n\nWhile their role in the body is vital for circulation, they are also implicated in tumor growth and development, particularly within the TME.  \n\",9\n97,IN VITRO,\"The **IN VITRO** model is a method of study used to investigate various biological processes, including cell differentiation, bone formation, angiogenesis, and the effects of specific compounds like Rg1 on osteoprogenitors.
