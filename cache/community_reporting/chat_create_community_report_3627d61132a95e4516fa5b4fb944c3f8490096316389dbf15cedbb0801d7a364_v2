This process is crucial for various physiological functions, including wound healing, tissue development, and tumor growth.  It involves a complex interplay of cellular processes, such as cell proliferation and vascular development. \n\n**Key aspects of neovascularization include:**\n\n* **Cell Proliferation:** ATG7, a protein involved in angiogenesis, plays a vital role in promoting cell division and growth, which are essential for creating new blood vessels.\n* **Vascular Development:**  Neovascularization contributes to the formation of new blood vessel structures during embryonic development and wound healing. \n* **Tumorigenesis:** Neovascularization is also implicated in tumor growth and progression, as it facilitates the delivery of nutrients and oxygen to cancerous cells.\n\n**Understanding neovascularization is crucial for addressing various medical conditions.**  For example, neovascularization plays a significant role in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), where new blood vessels form abnormally in the eye, leading to vision loss. \n\n\nThis summary provides a comprehensive overview of neovascularization by highlighting its key aspects and their relevance across different contexts. \n\",20\n1430,VASCULAR SYSTEM,\"The **vascular system** is a network of blood vessels in the human body.
