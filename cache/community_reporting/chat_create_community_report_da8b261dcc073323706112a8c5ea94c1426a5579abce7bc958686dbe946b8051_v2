The TME is often described as a \"\"complex system\"\" of cells and tissues surrounding the tumor, where interactions between cancer cells and immune cells are particularly significant.  The study of the TME is essential for understanding how tumors develop and respond to therapy, making it a key area of research in oncology. \n\",8\n2075,CLEAR-CELL RENAL CELL CARCINOMA,Type of kidney cancer discussed in the text,4\n2078,PRE-CLINICAL EVIDENCE,,3\n2079,DRUG DEVELOPMENT,,3\n3848,INTERSTITIAL FLOW,\"The **interstitial flow** refers to the movement of fluids within the spaces between cells and tissues.
