It functions as an adhesion molecule, facilitating cell-to-cell interactions and playing a role in immune responses.  Specifically, ICAM-1 participates in the process of angiogenesis, which involves the formation of new blood vessels, by mediating cell adhesion and migration during this process. Additionally, ICAM-1 is involved in inflammation, where it contributes to the recruitment and activation of immune cells at sites of injury or infection. \n\",2\n38,VEGFA,\"**VEGFA**, also known as **Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A (VEGF-A)**, is a protein involved in both **angiogenesis** and the immune response. It plays a crucial role in cell growth and development, acting as a **growth factor** that promotes angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels.  VEGFA is a signaling pathway component and a gene that codes for a protein involved in angiogenesis. This protein stimulates angiogenesis and contributes to tumor growth. \n\nIt's important to note that VEGFA can act independently or as part of a larger signaling pathway. It regulates vascular development and plays a significant role in cancer progression.  \n\",32\n1974,M5 MICROENVIRONMENT,Microenvironment where cells are studied,3\n659,P-AKT,\"The **P-AKT** protein is a molecule found to increase in cells and tissues when exposed to high glucose levels.

It is a key component in cancer development, as uncontrolled cell proliferation can lead to tumor formation.  This process is accelerated by Shikonin, a compound found in some plants. Measurement of cell growth and proliferation is crucial for understanding various biological processes, including cancer research. Cell proliferation involves the rate at which cells divide, and it's also described as the process of cells dividing and growing. \n\",1\n1882,MOTILITY,,1\n651,EGFL7,\"The **EGFL7** protein is a gene product whose expression levels are increased in cells and tissues under high glucose conditions.  It is also a target of miR-497-5p, meaning it's regulated by this microRNA. The **EGFL7** gene is upregulated by the drug TMP (trimethoprim). This protein plays a role in retinal vascular endothelial cells and has been included in studies related to its function. \n\",4\n660,HRECS,\"The **HRECS** are human retinal epithelial cells, which are commonly used in research to study angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels), cell migration, and proliferation. \n\",1\n5145,AT,A type of tissue,2\n5144,ADIPOCYTES,Cells that store fat,2\n1959,CD31<SUP>HI</SUP>EMCN<SUP>HI</SUP> ENDOTH,Endothelial cells with high CD31 and EMCN expression,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n757,ICAM-1,ANGIOGENESIS,ICAM-1 promotes angiogenesis in psoriasis,116\n241,VEGFA,PI3K,The PI3K enzyme is involved in the VEGFA signaling pathway,39\n747,M5 MICROENVIRONMENT,VEGFA,VEGFA is upregulated in the M5 microenvironment,35\n240,P-AKT,VEGFA,P-AKT and VEGFA are involved in the PI3K/AKT/VEGFA signaling pathway,34\n743,HYPERTROPHIC CHONDROCYTES,VEGFA,Hypertrophic chondrocytes secrete VEGFA,34\n2233,CUSHING SYNDROME,VEGFA,Higher VEGFA expression is associated with a better metabolic profile in Cushing syndrome,34\n716,VEGFA,CELL PROLIFERATION,VEGFA promotes cell proliferation,33\n717,VEGFA,MOTILITY,VEGFA promotes cell motility,33\n235,EGFL7,HRECS,\"EGFL7 knockdown downregulated the proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis capacity of HRECS\",5\n2234,CUSHING SYNDROME,AT,Higher VEGFA expression is associated with a better metabolic profile in Cushing syndrome,4\n2236,ADIPOCYTES,AT,Adipocytes negatively control AT expansion and metabolic health,4\n744,HYPERTROPHIC CHONDROCYTES,CD31<SUP>HI</SUP>EMCN<SUP>HI</SUP> ENDOTH,Hypertrophic chondrocytes promote tube formation of CD31<sup>hi</sup>EMCN<sup>hi</sup> endothelial cells,3\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
