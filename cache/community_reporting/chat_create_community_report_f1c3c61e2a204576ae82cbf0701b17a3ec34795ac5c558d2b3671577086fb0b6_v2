This method is often used in research, particularly when studying angiogenesis and metastasis.  It involves using living organisms as subjects for research, allowing scientists to observe biological processes within a natural environment. The study location can be either an actual living organism or a simulated environment that mimics the conditions found in living organisms. In vivo analysis was performed on living organisms to investigate anti-inflammatory properties. \n\",3\n2969,ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION,\"**Endothelial function** refers to the biological processes that regulate blood vessel health and efficiency. This function directly impacts blood flow and oxygen delivery throughout the body, ensuring proper circulation and nutrient transport.  It is a crucial component of overall cardiovascular health, as healthy endothelial cells are essential for maintaining optimal blood vessel function. \n\",3\n1158,FIBRIN GEL,\"The **FIBRIN GEL** is a type of gel used in research and also used for wound closure. \n\",2\n219,IN VITRO,\"\"\"In vitro\"\" is a method of studying cells outside the body, typically conducted in a laboratory setting. It encompasses various techniques used to investigate cell behavior, including cell culture experiments, angiogenesis studies, cell migration and invasion analysis, and the study of antimicrobial properties.  The \"\"in vitro\"\" approach allows researchers to control environmental factors and isolate specific cellular processes for detailed investigation. This method is often employed to examine the effects of treatments or inhibitors on cells in a controlled environment, such as when studying TAK1 inhibition's impact on angiogenesis.
