It is also known to be an isopropyl caffeic acid metabolite, meaning it's formed from the breakdown of caffeic acid in the body. \n\",4\n86,HUMAN UMBILICAL VEIN ENDOTHELIAL CELLS,\"The **HUMAN UMBILICAL VEIN ENDOTHELIAL CELLS** (HUVECs) are a type of human cell derived from human umbilical cords. These cells are crucial for research, particularly in the fields of angiogenesis and cell migration/proliferation.  They play a vital role in blood vessel formation and are used as a cellular model to study various biological processes like hypoxia treatment and cell viability. HUVECs are commonly employed in co-culture experiments with other cell types such as HT-ASC-EVs and ASC-EVs, allowing for the investigation of their interactions and effects on angiogenesis.  Their use in biomedical research stems from their ability to mimic the function of endothelial cells found in blood vessels, making them a valuable tool for understanding vascular development and disease. \n\",10\n2550,WJ-MSCS ECM,,2\n1399,PI3K/AKT,A protein kinase involved in cell signaling,5\n1772,LGALS3BP,\"The **LGALS3BP** protein is involved in angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels. It plays a crucial role in tumor neovascularization, which refers to the development of new blood vessels within tumors.  Furthermore, LGALS3BP contributes to microglia-induced angiogenesis, where immune cells called microglia play a role in promoting blood vessel growth.  In essence, **LGALS3BP** is a protein that actively participates in the process of forming new blood vessels, both in healthy tissues and in tumor environments. \n\",7\n1775,HMC3 CELLS,Cells that are hypoxic,4\n1778,ANGIOGENESIS-RELATED FACTOR EXPRESSION,,1\n1777,MICROLIA,,1\n2838,MEK/ERK,Another signaling pathway involved in cell growth and survival,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n649,MICROGLIA,ANGIOGENESIS,Microglia are involved in angiogenesis,151\n1116,KYZ,HUVECS,\"KYZ may promote angiogenesis through VEGF, PI3K/AKT, and MEK/ERK signaling pathways\",60\n176,HUMAN UMBILICAL VEIN ENDOTHELIAL CELLS,HT-ASC-EVS,The cells were used to co-culture with HT-ASC-EVs and ASC-EVs,15\n998,HUMAN UMBILICAL VEIN ENDOTHELIAL CELLS,WJ-MSCS ECM,WJ-MSCs ECM improved the angiogenesis ability of HUVECs in vitro,12\n512,PI3K/AKT,NF-ΚB,The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway can activate NF-κB to inhibit acellular capillary formation in the retina,11\n645,LGALS3BP,MICROGLIA,LGALS3BP is expressed in microglia,11\n656,HMC3 CELLS,LGALS3BP,Suppression of proangiogenic ability and angiogenesis-related factor expression after silencing LGALS3BP,11\n659,LGALS3BP,ANGIOGENESIS-RELATED FACTOR EXPRESSION,Promotes angiogenesis through the PI3K/AKT pathway,8\n657,HMC3 CELLS,MICROLIA,LGALS3BP promotes angiogenesis in microglia,5\n1119,KYZ,MEK/ERK,KYZ activates the MEK/ERK signaling pathway,5\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
