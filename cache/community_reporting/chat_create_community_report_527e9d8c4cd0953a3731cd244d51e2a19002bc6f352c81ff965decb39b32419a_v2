It is a key growth factor involved in cell survival, tissue repair, and blood vessel growth. VEGF promotes angiogenesis by stimulating the formation of new blood vessels.  It has been shown to be associated with both positive and negative effects on bone health, including promoting bone regeneration but also potentially contributing to paradoxical bone loss when stimulated. \n\nVEGF is a signaling molecule involved in angiogenesis and is often used as a biomarker for coronary collateral establishment. Its expression levels can be increased by various treatments like PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma) treatment and may be decreased in certain studies.  It has been linked to tumor growth and angiogenesis, making it a target for cancer therapies. \n\nVEGF is also involved in wound healing and blood vessel formation, acting as a substance that promotes these processes.
