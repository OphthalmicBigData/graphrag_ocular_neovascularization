It plays a significant role in cell signaling, gene expression regulation, and various physiological functions.  \n\nSpecifically, STAT3 participates in cell proliferation, angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels), and the regulation of molecules like CCL14 and VEGF-A. Its involvement in embryo implantation is also noteworthy.  Furthermore, STAT3 acts as a transcription activator, influencing the expression of numerous genes and proteins involved in cellular processes. \n\",4\n213,ENDOMETRIUM,\"The **endometrium** is the inner lining of the uterus. It plays a crucial role in menstruation, and is also involved in tissue lining the uterus.  It's part of the female reproductive system and is located within the uterus. The endometrium is affected by adenomyosis, a condition where the endometrium thickens abnormally. Research on endometrial cancer often focuses on this tissue. Additionally, the endometrium is essential for implantation during pregnancy and is involved in angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels).  \n\",14\n1028,IL-6,\"The **IL-6** cytokine is a key player in inflammation.

This condition can occur when the endometrium grows outside of its usual position within the uterine cavity, leading to potential complications and health issues. \n\",1\n1273,EGF,\"The **EGF** (Epidermal Growth Factor) is a growth factor known for its role in cell proliferation. It is also commonly used as a substance in cell culture experiments to stimulate cell growth and differentiation.  Furthermore, EGF has been shown to induce changes in gene expression, making it a valuable tool in various biological research areas. \n\",2\n229,IL-1Β,\"The **IL-1β** is a cytokine involved in inflammation. It is also a type of protein that can be used to treat thin endometrium.
