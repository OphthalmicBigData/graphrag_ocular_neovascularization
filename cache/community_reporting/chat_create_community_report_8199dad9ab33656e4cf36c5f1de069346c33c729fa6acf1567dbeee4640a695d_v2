It involves abnormal growth of blood vessels in the retina, leading to vision loss. CNV can be detected early in the study period and requires treatment with intravitreal injections or other interventions.  It can also lead to exudative recurrence, meaning the condition may return after initial treatment. \n\nCNV is a type of genetic variation that can be detected by OCT (optical coherence tomography) and OCTA (optical coherence tomography angiography). It is often studied in research as a model for eye diseases, particularly in patients with macular degeneration (AMD).  The condition can manifest as various types, including Type 1 CNV, which may help differentiate between neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR).\n\nCNV is often diagnosed through OCT imaging and can be a significant factor in the diagnosis of conditions like central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities.  It can also be associated with other eye conditions such as corneal neovascularization, where new blood vessels form on the cornea. \n\n\n**Note:** This summary provides a comprehensive overview of CNV based on the provided descriptions.
