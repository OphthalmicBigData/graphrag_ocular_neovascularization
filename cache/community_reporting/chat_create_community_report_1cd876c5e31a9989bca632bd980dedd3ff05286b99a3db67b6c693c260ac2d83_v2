It is often associated with age-related macular degeneration and can occur after retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroid graft translocation surgery.  MNV is a type of neovascularization, meaning new blood vessels grow abnormally in the eye. The study focused on the development of MNV in angioid streaks. \n\",8\n170,AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION,\"**Age-related macular degeneration (AMD)** is a common condition that affects vision in older people, often causing significant vision loss.
