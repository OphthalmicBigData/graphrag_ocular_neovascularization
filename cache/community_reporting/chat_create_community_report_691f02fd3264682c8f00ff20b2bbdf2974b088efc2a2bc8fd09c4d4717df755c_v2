It plays a crucial role in various physiological and pathological processes, including embryonic development, wound healing, tumor growth, and ischemic tissue repair. \n\nAngiogenesis is characterized by the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, which form the lining of blood vessels. This process can be stimulated by various factors, such as hypoxia (low oxygen levels), inflammation, and growth factors.  It is essential for maintaining a healthy circulatory and lymphatic system, but excessive angiogenesis can contribute to tumor development and other diseases like cancer. \n\nThe study of angiogenesis has led to the development of anti-angiogenic therapies aimed at inhibiting this process in cancer treatment.
