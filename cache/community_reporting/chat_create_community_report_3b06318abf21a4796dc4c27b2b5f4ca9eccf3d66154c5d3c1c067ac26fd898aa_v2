The process of CNV can also be studied using models like the laser-induced CNV model, which helps researchers understand age-related macular degeneration.  CNV can impair corneal transparency and visual acuity, leading to decreased vision. \n\nWhile some descriptions mention CNV occurring more often than expected, it's important to remember that this condition is not always present in a clinical setting.
