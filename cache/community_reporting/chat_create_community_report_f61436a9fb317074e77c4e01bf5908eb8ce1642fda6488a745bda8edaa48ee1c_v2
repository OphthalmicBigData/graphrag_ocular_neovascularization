They form part of the circulatory system and are vital for the growth and development of organisms.  They also play a critical role in wound healing and bone regeneration. \n\nSpecifically, blood vessels can be found in various locations within the body:\n\n* **Ovarian and vaginal tissues:** These areas contain specific types of blood vessels.\n* **Dermis:** Blood vessels are present in the dermis layer of skin.\n* **Lower extremities:**  Blood vessels supply blood to this area of the body. \n* **Body affected by diabetes:** Diabetes can impact blood vessel function, leading to complications.\n\nFurthermore, angiogenesis, a process of new blood vessel formation, is essential for various bodily functions and wound healing. This process creates structures that transport blood throughout the body.  \n\n\nIt's important to note that blood vessels are also directly impacted by conditions like diabetes, highlighting their vital role in overall health. \n\",8\n906,EXOSOMES,\"Exosomes are tiny vesicles released by cells that can be found in bodily fluids.
