It is characterized by the presence of a mass of abnormal cells, often leading to tissue distortion and impacting normal bodily functions.  Tumors are subject to study due to their complex nature and potential for inhibiting angiogenesis, a process crucial for tumor growth. The **tumor microenvironment** plays a significant role in tumor development and progression. \n\nThe specific type of tumor being studied can vary widely, but all tumors share the common characteristic of abnormal cell growth.  \n\",8\n420,MACROPHAGES,\"## Macrophages: Immune Cells Involved in Healing and Inflammation\n\nMacrophages are a type of immune cell playing crucial roles in both health and disease.  They are involved in various processes, including **healing**, **regulating the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (nAMD)**, **wound healing**, and **inflammation**. These cells are found throughout the body, particularly in tissues like the brain, where they contribute to immune function. \n\nMacrophages are known for their ability to engulf pathogens, cellular debris, and foreign substances, acting as a first line of defense against infection.  They also play a significant role in **angiogenesis**, the formation of new blood vessels, and **inflammation**. Their influence extends to both **tumor growth** - where they can either help or hinder it - and the **tumor microenvironment**. \n\nMacrophages are particularly important in **ophthalmology**, where they contribute to fighting infection and promoting healing within the eye.  They are also being studied as potential targets for **targeted therapies** due to their ability to influence tumor growth.  Their involvement in inflammation and tissue regeneration makes them a key player in both health and disease. \n\",13\n449,TME,\"The **TME** (Tumor Microenvironment) is a complex ecosystem surrounding tumor cells. It encompasses various components, including immune cells, stromal cells, and extracellular matrix, all contributing to the tumor's growth and progression.  Within the context of the **CoM** (Cancerome), the TME serves as a status that reflects the dynamic interplay between tumor cells and their surroundings. \n\",6\n3058,GLIOBLASTOMA STEM CELLS,Glioma stem cells are a type of cancer cell,3\n5307,7A,\"The entity **7A** is a substance that acts as a drug or molecule, promoting diabetic wound healing. \n\",3\n4690,UTERINE INJURIES,A condition that needs treatment,1\n4691,ANTI-INFLAMMATORY FACTORS,Chemicals that reduce inflammation,1\n1517,NSCLC,\"The **NSCLC** (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer) is a specific type of cancer affecting the lungs.

Research on NSCLC has focused on understanding its cellular characteristics and studying its response to combination therapies. \n\",2\n3217,GLI1,\"The **GLI1** gene is a significant player in the development of **NSCLC (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer)**. It plays a role in metastasis, meaning it contributes to the spread of cancer cells from the original site to other parts of the body.  Furthermore, GLI1 is linked to tumor growth and angiogenesis, which refers to the formation of new blood vessels that supply tumors with nutrients and oxygen. This gene's involvement in these processes makes it a potential target for therapeutic interventions aimed at halting or slowing down NSCLC progression. \n\",10\n497,ESM1,\"The **ESM1** protein is a crucial player in tumor angiogenesis, the process by which tumors grow new blood vessels.
