It can occur in various organs, including the liver, where it's known as **chronic liver disease**.  This process involves replacing healthy tissue with scar tissue, leading to organ dysfunction. Fibrosis can manifest in different forms, such as **subcutaneous adipose tissue fibrosis**, which refers to the formation of scar tissue in fat cells. The condition is often described as a disease that causes scarring and can lead to various complications depending on the affected area. \n\",3\n2869,LYMPANGIOGENESIS,,3\n367,LYMPHANGIOGENESIS,\"**Lymphangiogenesis** is the process of forming new lymphatic vessels.
