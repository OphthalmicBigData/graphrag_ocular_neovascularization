This condition, often seen in eye diseases, can disrupt corneal avascularity and lead to vision impairment.  It can be a major cause of blindness and significantly affect quality of life. Corneal neovascularization involves the formation of new blood vessels within the cornea, which can grow into normally avascular areas. This process is often triggered by injury or underlying eye diseases. While it can be treated with therapies like PDT (photodynamic therapy) and bevacizumab, corneal neovascularization remains a sight-threatening condition that requires careful management. \n\",14\n697,VEGFA GENE,,2\n791,AL NEOVASCULARIZATION,Area of study in corneal neovascularization,2\n695,VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR (VEGF-A),A protein involved in corneal angiogenesis,1\n700,INFECTIVE KERATITIS,Infective keratitis is a corneal pathological disease,1\n701,CHEMICAL BURN,Chemical burn is a corneal pathological disease,1\n702,CORNEAL LIMBAL STEM CELL DEFICIENCY,Corneal limbal stem cell deficiency is a corneal pathological disease,1\n703,MECHANICAL TRAUMA,Mechanical trauma is a corneal pathological disease,1\n704,IMMUNOLOGICAL REJECTION,Immunological rejection after keratoplasties is a complication of corneal pathological diseases,1\n3340,UNIVERSITI,Universiti is a medical institution,1\n792,THERAPEUTIC OUTCOMES,Potential outcomes of treatment for corneal neovascularization,2\n696,CLUSTERED REGULARLY INTERSPACED SHORT PALINDROMIC REPEATS (CRISPR)/CAS9,A gene editing tool,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n242,CORNEAL NEOVASCULARIZATION,VEGFA GENE,The VEGFA gene plays a central role in corneal angiogenesis,16\n260,AL NEOVASCULARIZATION,CORNEAL NEOVASCULARIZATION,Al neovascularization area is a focus in the study of corneal neovascularization,16\n241,CORNEAL NEOVASCULARIZATION,VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR (VEGF-A),CNV is a condition that affects VEGF-A expression,15\n244,CORNEAL NEOVASCULARIZATION,INFECTIVE KERATITIS,Corneal neovascularization can be caused by infective keratitis,15\n245,CORNEAL NEOVASCULARIZATION,CHEMICAL BURN,Corneal neovascularization can be caused by chemical burn,15\n246,CORNEAL NEOVASCULARIZATION,CORNEAL LIMBAL STEM CELL DEFICIENCY,Corneal neovascularization can be caused by corneal limbal stem cell deficiency,15\n247,CORNEAL NEOVASCULARIZATION,MECHANICAL TRAUMA,Corneal neovascularization can be caused by mechanical trauma,15\n248,CORNEAL NEOVASCULARIZATION,IMMUNOLOGICAL REJECTION,Corneal neovascularization can be caused by immunological rejection after keratoplasties,15\n1373,UNIVERSITI,CORNEAL NEOVASCULARIZATION,Universiti conducted a study on topical bevacizumab for corneal neovascularization,15\n261,AL NEOVASCULARIZATION,THERAPEUTIC OUTCOMES,The study of al neovascularization area is a focus in the discussion of therapeutic outcomes for corneal neovascularization,4\n243,CLUSTERED REGULARLY INTERSPACED SHORT PALINDROMIC REPEATS (CRISPR)/CAS9,VEGFA GENE,CRISPR/Cas9 can edit the VEGFA gene to suppress its expression,3\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
