It can cause vision loss and is often associated with other retinal conditions like Stargardt disease and age-related macular degeneration (AMD).  MNV is characterized by damage to the blood vessels in the macula, leading to inflammation and potential vision impairment. \n\nWhile MNV can be a rare complication of certain genetic disorders such as choroideraemia and rod-cone dystrophies, it can also occur independently. It's important to note that MNV is often diagnosed through medical examinations and follow-up assessments, particularly when the condition progresses to a more severe form known as T3 MNV (T3 Macular Neurovascular degeneration). \n\n\n**Note:** The term \"\"MNV\"\" can be used interchangeably with other terms like \"\"Myopic macular neuropathy,\"\" \"\"Myopic macular neovascularization,\"\" or \"\"Multi-nucleated virus.\"\"  \n\",19\n1545,PROANGIOGENIC MILIEU,The proangiogenic milieu is a biological environment that promotes blood vessel growth,1\n2224,STARGARDT DISEASE,Late-onset form of IRD,1\n2225,EXUDATIVE AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION (AMD),A type of vision loss,1\n2226,PERIPHERALINOPATHIES,,1\n2227,ANTI-VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR (ANTI-VEGF),,1\n2228,BESTROPHINOPATHIES,,1\n2229,ENHANCED S-CONE SYNDROME,,1\n3238,SE,Study area in the study,1\n3239,AXIAL LENGTH,Measurement used in the study,1\n4672,RAP,A specific type of retinal condition,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n552,MNV,PROANGIOGENIC MILIEU,The MNV's presence in the body can affect the proangiogenic milieu,20\n904,STARGARDT DISEASE,MNV,\"MNV is a symptom of Stargardt disease\nStargardt disease can cause MNV to develop\",20\n905,EXUDATIVE AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION (AMD),MNV,AMD may present as MNV in some cases,20\n906,MNV,PERIPHERALINOPATHIES,Peripherinopathies can develop MNV,20\n907,MNV,ANTI-VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR (ANTI-VEGF),Anti-VEGF therapy can help with MNV in some cases,20\n908,MNV,BESTROPHINOPATHIES,Bestrophinopathies tend to develop MNV early on,20\n909,MNV,ENHANCED S-CONE SYNDROME,Enhanced S-cone syndrome can cause type 3 MNV,20\n1348,MNV,SE,Macular neuropathy was measured in the study area SE,20\n1349,MNV,AXIAL LENGTH,Macular neuropathy was measured in the study area axial length,20\n2016,MNV,RAP,MNV is a specific type of RAP,20\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
