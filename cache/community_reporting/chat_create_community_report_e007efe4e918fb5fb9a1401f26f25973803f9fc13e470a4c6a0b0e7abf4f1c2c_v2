It is a specific derivative of itaconate, meaning it shares structural similarities with this naturally occurring molecule.  \n\",3\n2511,MATRIGEL,\"Matrigel is a type of extracellular matrix used for cell culture, serving as an essential component in various research applications. It plays a crucial role in angiogenesis studies, where it serves as an assay material. Matrigel is also utilized to create 3D models of the extracellular matrix, facilitating the study of angiogenesis in a more realistic and complex environment.  Furthermore, Matrigel is commonly used to culture endothelial cells for research purposes. \n\",2\n29,ENDOTHELIAL CELLS,\"Endothelial cells are cells found in blood vessels. They line the inner surface of blood vessels, forming a continuous layer known as the endothelium. These cells play crucial roles in blood vessel formation and growth, contributing to vascular development and maintenance.  Endothelial cells also interact with other cells and molecules, including those involved in the process of angiogenesis (blood vessel formation). Notably, endothelial cells are particularly sensitive to biological signals called \"\"BREs\"\" (likely referring to \"\"bradykinin receptors\"\"), which can influence their function and behavior. Endothelial cells are a subject of study in various fields, including vascular biology and medicine, as they provide insights into the complexities of blood vessel development and disease processes. \n\",32\n1909,MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE,\"The **Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)** is a class of proteases involved in various biological processes, including angiogenesis. These enzymes play a crucial role in breaking down proteins and contribute to the breakdown of extracellular matrix components, which is essential for tissue remodeling and repair.
