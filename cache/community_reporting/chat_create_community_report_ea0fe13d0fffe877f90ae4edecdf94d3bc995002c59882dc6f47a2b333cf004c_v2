This process is critical for regulating inflammation and tissue repair.  For example, T cell activation can trigger the production of cytokines like TNF-α and IFN-γ, which promote M1 macrophage differentiation. Conversely, T cell suppression can lead to an increase in M2 macrophage polarization, contributing to a more anti-inflammatory environment.
