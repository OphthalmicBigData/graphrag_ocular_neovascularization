It functions as a signal transducer and activator of transcription 6, meaning it receives signals from outside cells and then transmits them to the cell's nucleus to initiate changes in gene expression.  Specifically, STAT6 plays a role in IL-13 signaling, where it regulates the production of various proteins involved in immune responses and inflammation.  \n\",6\n373,IL-8,\"IL-8, also known as interleukin-8, is a cytokine involved in both inflammation and angiogenesis. It acts as a signaling molecule that promotes endothelial cell migration and tube formation, contributing to the development of new blood vessels (angiogenesis).  Furthermore, IL-8 plays a role in tumor progression by promoting tumor growth and development.  It has been implicated in the progression of various cancers, acting as a protein involved in tumor biology.  IL-8 is secreted by As-T cells, which can activate other cells to further contribute to inflammation and tumor progression. \n\",8\n139,TUMOR,\"A **tumor** is an abnormal growth of cells that can grow and spread, often leading to cancerous conditions. It's a biological entity that develops from cells and can be classified as a type of cancer or disease.  Tumors are characterized by their mass of abnormal cells and can potentially become cancerous.
