They are defined by their ability to **grow abnormally**, leading to the formation of **tumours**.  These cells often express endothelial cell markers, indicating a potential for **angiogenesis**, the process of forming new blood vessels. Furthermore, tumour cells can contribute to cancer development by directly causing it or promoting its progression through various mechanisms. \n\",3\n1230,VASCULOGENIC MIMICRY,\"VASCULOGENIC MIMICRY is a process that creates an alternative microvascular circulation system independent of traditional angiogenesis. This means tumor cells can develop their own blood vessels, bypassing the need for normal blood vessel formation.  This process allows tumor cells to create their own vascular system, which provides them with an alternative method for obtaining blood supply and potentially enabling tumor growth and spread. \n\",6\n3809,HIGH TUMOR GRADE,,1\n1932,MICRORNAS,\"**Micrornas (also known as microRNAs)** are a class of RNA molecules that play a crucial role in regulating gene expression.  They are non-coding RNAs that act to control the production of proteins by influencing how genes are expressed. MicroRNAs contribute significantly to various biological processes, making them essential components of cellular function. \n\",3\n335,METASTASIS,\"**Metastasis** is the process of spreading cancer cells from a primary tumor to other parts of the body. This spread, also known as the **spread of cancer cells**, can occur through various mechanisms and ultimately results in the growth of secondary tumors in distant organs.  The descriptions highlight that metastasis involves the **expansion of cancer cells** beyond their initial location, leading to the formation of new tumors in different areas of the body. \n\",2\n12,CELL CYCLE,\"The **cell cycle** is a series of events that take place in a cell as it grows and divides. This process, influenced by genes such as SEMA3D and IL33, allows cells to progress through distinct stages, ultimately leading to their growth and eventual division into two daughter cells. \n\",1\n3808,ENDOTHELIAL CELL-LINED VESSELS,Normal blood vessel structure,1\n3700,SIG1R,\"The **SIG1R** protein is involved in both **breast cancer (BC)** treatment and cancer. \n\",2\n3702,Β-INTEGRIN,,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n497,JAM-A,SURVIVAL,Overexpression of JAM-A enhances MSC survival,14\n1560,TUMOR CELLS,VASCULOGENIC MIMICRY,VM is a process where tumor cells create their own vascular system,9\n1562,VASCULOGENIC MIMICRY,HIGH TUMOR GRADE,VM is correlated with high tumor grade,7\n724,MICRORNAS,METASTASIS,MicroRNAs can influence metastasis through their effects on cell cycle and angiogenesis,5\n723,MICRORNAS,CELL CYCLE,MicroRNAs can regulate gene expression involved in cell cycle alterations,4\n1561,TUMOR CELLS,ENDOTHELIAL CELL-LINED VESSELS,Tumor cells express endothelial cell markers to form their own vessels,4\n1473,SIG1R,Β-INTEGRIN,Sig1R forms a complex with β-integrin to promote ECM-mediated BC cell proliferation and angiogenesis,3\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
