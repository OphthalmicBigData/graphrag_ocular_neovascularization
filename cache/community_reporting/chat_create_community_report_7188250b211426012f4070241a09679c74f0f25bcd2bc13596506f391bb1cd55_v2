This process, also known as **repairing bones**, aims to rebuild and strengthen the skeletal structure after a fracture or other injury.  It encompasses various stages, including inflammation, callus formation, and ossification. \n\",3\n382,OXIDATIVE STRESS,\"**Oxidative stress** is a condition where there's an imbalance between free radicals, unstable molecules that can damage cells, and antioxidants, substances that neutralize these free radicals. This imbalance can lead to cellular damage and contribute to the development of diseases.  It occurs in the body as a natural process, but when it becomes excessive, it can have detrimental effects on health. \n\",2\n2320,M2 MACROPHAGES,\"**M2 macrophages** are a subtype of macrophages known for their role in promoting **angiogenesis**, the formation of new blood vessels. They are also involved in **bone repair** and play a crucial role in **tissue regeneration** by promoting healing.  These macrophages exhibit a **pro-inflammatory phenotype**, which can contribute to both tissue repair and inflammation. \n\",5\n1166,TUG1,\"The **TUG1** gene plays a crucial role in various biological processes. It is involved in angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, and hypoxia response, which refers to the body's adaptation to low oxygen levels.  Furthermore, TUG1 has been linked to the development of OIR (Oxygen-Induced Retinopathy), a condition affecting the retina that can lead to vision loss. Notably, TUG1 protein is known to reduce the expression of VEGFA, a protein involved in angiogenesis and vascular growth. \n\",3\n880,ENDOTHELIAL CELL,\"**Endothelial cells** are specialized cells that form the inner lining of blood vessels.  They play a crucial role in vascular development and function, contributing to the formation and maintenance of blood vessel networks. These cells are also studied in the OGD-SD model, which is used to investigate cellular responses to ischemia/reperfusion injury. Notably, FGD5, a protein involved in various cellular processes, regulates endothelial cell activity.  Furthermore, endothelial cells are essential for blood vessel development and formation. \n\",8\n1120,PFD,Substance being investigated for its effect on angiogenesis,8\n1089,HYPOXIA,\"**Hypoxia** is a condition characterized by a **scarcity of oxygen in the body**. This can manifest as a lack of oxygen, or a deprivation of sufficient oxygen levels.  It's often described as a **prolonged hypoxic condition**, and it can be seen in various contexts such as solid tumors where oxygen scarcity is prevalent. The condition itself is studied extensively, with descriptions ranging from \"\"**a condition of low oxygen levels**\"\" to \"\"**the condition studied**\"\". \n\",7\n979,APOPTOSIS,\"**Apoptosis** is a **programmed cell death** process that involves the dismantling and removal of cells in a controlled manner. It is a crucial cellular process related to **miR-210**, which plays a role in regulating apoptosis.  This process, also known as **cell death**, is characterized by specific morphological changes and biochemical events, including the activation of caspases, DNA fragmentation, and membrane blebbing. Apoptosis can be considered a form of **cellular process** that ensures proper development, tissue homeostasis, and elimination of damaged or unwanted cells. \n\",6\n2994,CHEMERIN,Chemerin is a multifunctional protein initially characterized in our laboratory,5\n4404,ADAMTS9-AS2,\"The **ADAMTS9-AS2** is a protein involved in both blood clotting and inflammation.
