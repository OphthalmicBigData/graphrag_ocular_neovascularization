This condition is associated with poor postoperative angiogenesis, meaning the body's ability to form new blood vessels is impaired, particularly in patients with **MMD (Malignant Melanoma Disease)**.  High levels of HHCY are linked to negative outcomes in post-operative MMD patients, highlighting its potential role in cardiovascular complications. To assess cardiovascular risk, **HDL-C (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) and LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol)** are measured. \n\",1\n835,MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS,A chronic disease of the central nervous system,2\n838,RELAPSING-REMITTING MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS,,1\n929,CSCC,Type of cancer cells,2\n930,FKBP PROLILY ISOMERASE,A protein involved in tumor growth and angiogenesis,1\n2178,IWP-2,A chemical compound that inhibits the Wnt/β-catenin pathway,2\n2179,WNT//Β-CATENIN PATHWAY,Pathway involved in cell growth and development,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n127,ANGIOGENESIS,VEGFR2,VEGFR2 is involved in angiogenesis,159\n1000,GASTROINTESTINAL CANCER,ANGIOGENESIS,GIC angiogenesis is closely related to angiogenesis,152\n2031,DIBETES,ANGIOGENESIS,Diabetes affects angiogenesis,151\n1405,ANGIOGENESIS,TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINE,Traditional herbal medicine has been used to promote angiogenesis,150\n1642,KIRC,ANGIOGENESIS,Prognosis of KIRC is often related to angiogenesis,150\n1951,CXS,ANGIOGENESIS,Cx is associated with angiogenesis,150\n678,PCK,ANGIOGENESIS,Angiogenesis was significantly attenuated in the PCK rats,149\n1014,ISCHEMIC STROKE,ANGIOGENESIS,Stroke recovery relies on angiogenesis to restore blood supply,149\n1227,ANGIOGENESIS,LOCAL OXYGEN CONCENTRATION,Angiogenesis is influenced by local oxygen concentration,149\n1355,ANGIOGENESIS,DISEASE,Angiogenesis is regulated by genes and can be associated with diseases,149\n1496,ANGIOGENESIS,DIABETES,\"Lack of enough angiogensis can hinder tissue repair in diabetes\nLack of enough angiogensis can hinder tissue repair\",149\n1497,ANGIOGENESIS,TISSUE ENGINEERING,\"**Angiogenesis** and **tissue engineering** are closely related fields.
