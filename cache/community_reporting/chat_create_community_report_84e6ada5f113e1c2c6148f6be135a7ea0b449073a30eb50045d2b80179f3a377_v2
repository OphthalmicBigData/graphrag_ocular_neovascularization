This transformation involves changes in gene expression, cell morphology, and extracellular matrix production.  It is often characterized by the loss of epithelial characteristics like polarity and cell-cell adhesion, and the acquisition of mesenchymal features such as motility and invasiveness. The EMT can be triggered by various stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, and mechanical stress.
