These factors are utilized in various therapeutic approaches, including those aimed at tissue repair.  Pro-angiogenic therapies aim to promote this process for applications such as wound healing and regenerative medicine. \n\",5\n3589,DISEASE CONDITIONS,,4\n3590,DISEASE INTERVENTION,,4\n3585,ANTI-ANGIOGENIC,\"The **anti-angiogenic** class of factors refers to substances or processes that inhibit the growth and development of new blood vessels. This inhibition is achieved through various mechanisms, including blocking the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) itself. \n\",4\n3586,V2,\"The **V2** entity is a molecule characterized by its ability to modulate angiogenesis, meaning it influences the formation of new blood vessels. It achieves this through binding to VEGF receptors, which are proteins involved in regulating blood vessel growth. Notably, V2 exhibits remarkable stability against proteolytic hydrolysis, a process where enzymes break down proteins, making it highly resistant to degradation. \n\",4\n3587,V3,\"The **V3** molecule is a unique entity characterized by its ability to modulate angiogenesis. It functions as a peptide sequence that specifically targets VEGF receptors, effectively inhibiting the process of angiogenesis. Notably, V3 exhibits exceptional stability against proteolytic hydrolysis, making it a robust and enduring molecule with potential applications in various fields. \n\",4\n196,TISSUE REPAIR,\"The **tissue repair** process involves using pro-angiogenic therapies to restore and regenerate damaged tissues.
