Studies have shown its effectiveness in inhibiting cell growth and inducing apoptosis (programmed cell death) in various pancreatic cancer models. This suggests Lycorine holds potential as a novel therapeutic agent for this challenging disease.  Lycorine's mechanism of action involves targeting specific pathways involved in tumor growth, such as angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels), which is crucial for tumor survival and metastasis. Additionally, Lycorine has shown promising results in reducing gemcitabine resistance, a common challenge in pancreatic cancer treatment. This suggests that Lycorine could potentially overcome drug resistance and improve treatment outcomes.
