This condition can lead to vision loss and is often studied as a model for age-related macular degeneration.  CNV can result from various factors, including genetic mutations, cancer, or even laser treatment. It involves changes in gene expression, cellular processes, and blood vessel size, impacting angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels). CNV has been observed in both humans and mice, with the latter being used to study its development and potential treatments.  Research on CNV focuses on understanding its mechanisms and developing therapies for vision loss associated with this condition. \n\",23\n366,SUBRETINAL FIBROSIS,\"Subretinal fibrosis is a complication of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (naAMD), a condition affecting the retina.
