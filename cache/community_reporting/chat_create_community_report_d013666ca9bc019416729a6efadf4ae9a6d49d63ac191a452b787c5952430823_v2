It is significantly impacted by the **stem cell secretome**, as demonstrated in diabetic rats where its influence on the healing process has been observed. This process encompasses the entire journey of wound closure, including initial inflammation, proliferation of cells, and ultimately tissue regeneration. The specific challenges posed by diabetes, such as impaired blood flow and increased oxidative stress, can significantly affect the efficiency of skin wound healing.  \n\",3\n102,INFLAMMATION,\"Inflammation is a biological process that occurs as a response to injury, irritation, or infection. It plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including the development of cancer, progression of Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV), and immune response.  Inflammation can be triggered by stem cell secretome in diabetic rats, leading to tissue damage. This process involves the migration of monocytes and is mentioned as a factor in the context of Idiopathic Central Serous Retinopathy (iCNV). Inflammation is also involved in the body's response to injury or infection, contributing to the development of CNV progression.  It can be observed in the retina, where inflammation is known to cause damage. \n\",5\n3812,SECRETOME,,8\n668,DIABETIC,Subject with diabetes,3\n1257,EPCS,\"**EPCS (Endothelial Progenitor Cells)** are a type of cell that plays a crucial role in **blood vessel formation**.
