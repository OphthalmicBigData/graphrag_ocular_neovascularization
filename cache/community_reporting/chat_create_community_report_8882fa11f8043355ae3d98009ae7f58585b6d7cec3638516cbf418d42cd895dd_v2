It is a key factor in the development of conditions like central venous insufficiency (CNV) and plays a role in neovascularization, particularly in response to ischemia.  Inflammation can be categorized into different grades, with lower grades observed in groups 1 and 2. The body's inflammatory response is crucial for healing and fighting infection. It is also a part of the pathogenesis of ischemia, where it contributes to tissue damage.  Various models have been used to study anti-inflammatory effects, including those involving inflammation itself. Inflammation can manifest in different ways, such as heart muscle inflammation or retinal inflammation caused by high blood sugar levels. The process of inflammation involves a series of responses that aim to repair and protect the body from injury or infection. \n\",10\n5438,TENDINOPATHIC INJURIES,Injuries to tendons,2\n23,CHRONIC WOUNDS,\"**Chronic wounds** are a significant health concern, posing a substantial burden on the healthcare system.
