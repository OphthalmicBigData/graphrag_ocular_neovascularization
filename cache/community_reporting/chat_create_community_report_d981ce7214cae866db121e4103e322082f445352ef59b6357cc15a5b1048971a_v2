This process allows us to see and interpret visual information. The retina contains specialized cells called photoreceptors, which convert light into electrical signals.

VEGF promotes the growth and proliferation of endothelial cells, leading to the development of new blood vessels. The retina contains specialized cells called retinal pericytes that produce VEGF.
