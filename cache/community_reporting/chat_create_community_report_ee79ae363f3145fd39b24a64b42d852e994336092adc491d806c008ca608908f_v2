It plays an important role in vision, as it helps to nourish and support the retina.  This layer is also involved in the process of light absorption and reflection, which are essential for clear vision. The choroid can be affected by age-related macular degeneration, a condition that affects central vision. \n\",4\n1037,ICNV,\"The **ICNV** (intraocular choroidal neovascularization) is a condition that can be treated with Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA).  Treatment often involves intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF drugs to address the underlying cause, which is typically choroidal neovascularization. \n\",3\n456,IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY,\"The **IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY** technique is a method used to study the structure and function of cells in tissue samples. It can be employed to investigate various aspects, including gene expression, protein expression, and tumor angiogenesis.
