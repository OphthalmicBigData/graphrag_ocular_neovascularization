It's a vital component of the eye, located at the back of the eye and responsible for converting light into electrical signals that are sent to the brain for processing.  \n\nThe retina is also part of the eye affected by ocular inflammation and vascular injury (OIR), where inflammatory factors are measured. Additionally, it's where light is focused before being transmitted to the brain. The retina is also a site of monocyte migration, meaning immune cells called monocytes travel through this area. \n\n\nLet me know if you would like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the retina or its function! \n\",6\n1439,ENDOTHELIAL,\"The **endothelial cells** are a type of cell that lines the inner surface of blood vessels.
