It is a biological entity that provides oxygen and nutrients for growth, and it is often associated with cancer.  Tumors are the source of angiogenesis, which is the formation of new blood vessels to supply the tumor with nutrients and oxygen. They can be studied in various ways, including by collecting tumor tissue samples for research or by observing their development in mice models.  **Tumors** are a type of cancer and are often treated using drugs that target specific pathways involved in tumor growth, such as anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anti-BRAF, and antiangiogenics. \n\",13\n3762,NANOBODY,A type of antibody,4\n1636,AGRIN,\"**AGRIN** knockout mice are a specific type of mouse used in research.

It serves as a biological model for studying various aspects of development, including tumor growth and angiogenesis.
