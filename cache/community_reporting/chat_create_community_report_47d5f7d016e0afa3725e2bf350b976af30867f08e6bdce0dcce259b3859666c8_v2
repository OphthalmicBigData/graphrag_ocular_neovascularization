It can refer to a research group or company focused on molecular docking and network pharmacology, as well as a specific anti-inflammatory drug that has shown potential in treating stroke. \n\nResearch on AS has explored its effects on myocardial infarction, with some studies suggesting it may promote angiogenesis (blood vessel growth). Additionally, AS has been investigated for its ability to reverse the effects of stroke.  A study specifically focused on the mechanism of action of AS in treating idiopathic stroke (IS) was conducted. \n\nIt's important to note that while AS is often associated with anti-inflammatory properties, it can also be a specific drug used for various medical purposes. The exact nature and application of AS depend on the context and the specific research or treatment being discussed.  \n\",17\n3731,CHINA,Country where AS is used to treat IS,2\n2389,MCAO/R,\"The **MCAo/R** model is a rat model used in research, specifically designed as a model of stroke. \n\",1\n1482,HIPPOCAMPUS,\"The **hippocampus** is a brain region that can be affected by surgery, strokes, and certain dietary factors.  It has been shown to be impacted by toothlessness and soft diet feeding, as well as exhibiting increased AngII mRNA levels in mice at the age of 20 days (J20). Additionally, the hippocampus is known to be involved in angiogenesis, a process where new blood vessels form. \n\",1\n1481,CEREBRAL CORTEX,\"The **cerebral cortex** is a brain region that plays a crucial role in higher cognitive functions. It is also significantly impacted by strokes, as it can be directly affected by the blockage of blood flow to the brain.
