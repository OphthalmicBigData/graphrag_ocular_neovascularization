This lack of oxygen can induce significant changes in gene expression and cellular function.  It can also enhance the release of angiogenesis-related factors, contributing to tumor growth and development. Hypoxia is often associated with the **tumor microenvironment**, where low oxygen levels are a common feature. It can be caused by various factors, including exposure to low oxygen environments or limited blood flow. \n\",6\n1764,SOX17,\"The **SOX17** gene plays a crucial role in various aspects of cardiovascular development. It is involved in the formation of coronary vessels, and its function is directly linked to the regulation of heart development.  Furthermore, SOX17 protein acts as a key component in cell signaling pathways, contributing to the growth and maturation of heart tissue. \n\",3\n357,HEART,\"The **heart** is a vital organ responsible for pumping blood throughout the body. It's an essential part of the circulatory system and is often referred to as the \"\"engine\"\" of the body.  It is also affected by cancer therapy, with some treatments impacting its function. Research on the heart, including studying its structure and function, is ongoing. The **myocardium**, a muscular layer within the heart, plays a crucial role in pumping blood. GSK-3, an enzyme involved in various cellular processes, has been found to affect the heart's health. \n\",3\n206,OSCC,\"**OSCC (Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma)** is a type of cancer that affects the cells lining the mouth, including the tongue, cheeks, and gums.  It can also be referred to as **oral squamous cell carcinoma cells**. \n\",2\n1767,CORONARY GROWTH,,2\n82,HUVEC,\"The **HUVEC** is a human umbilical vein endothelial cell line, commonly used in research for studying angiogenesis.  These cells are derived from human umbilical veins and are known as **Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells**.
