It is a type of AMD that can cause significant vision loss. \n\",6\n339,CHOROIDAL NEOVASCULARIZATION,\"**Choroidal neovascularization (CNV)** is a condition affecting the eye that involves the growth of new blood vessels in the choroid, a layer of tissue beneath the retina. This process can lead to leakage of fluid in the eye, causing vision loss. CNV is a hallmark feature of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and can be studied in mouse models.  It is also a late recurrence of CNV in elderly patients, making it a medical condition that needs to be predicted for treatment. \n\nCNV is often associated with wet AMD, a more severe form of AMD characterized by abnormal blood vessel formation in the choroid. While CNV can cause vision loss in both children and the elderly, it is particularly prevalent in the latter group.  The process of new blood vessel formation in the choroid (CNV) is being studied as part of research into age-related macular degeneration. \n\",16\n3366,CNV MOUSE MODEL,,2\n630,3-DIMENTIONAL SPECTRAL-DOMAIN OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY,Imaging technique used to measure CNV volume,1\n1535,BROWN NORWAY RATS,Brown Norway rats used in study,1\n1947,LASER PHOTOCOAGULATION,\"The **laser photocoagulation** procedure is a medical treatment used to address various eye conditions.
