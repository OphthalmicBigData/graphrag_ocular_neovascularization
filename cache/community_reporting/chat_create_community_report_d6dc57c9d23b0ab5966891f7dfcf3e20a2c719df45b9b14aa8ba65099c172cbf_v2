It is also implicated in the process of stress-induced choroidal neovascularization, where abnormal blood vessel growth occurs within the eye's retina. \n\",2\n845,CNV,\"**Choroidal neovascularization (CNV)** is a condition characterized by abnormal blood vessel growth in the eye. It can manifest as **Corneal neovascularization**, where new blood vessels grow abnormally in the cornea, or as **choroidal neovascularization**, which involves abnormal blood vessel growth in the choroid.  CNV is a subtype of exudative AMD and can be studied for treatment options, including those targeting HRMECs (hyperreflective micro-vessels). \n\nChanges in CNV size may influence injection intervals in certain conditions.  CNV is also a type of genetic variation that can affect cell viability and proliferation, potentially leading to tissue damage.  Research on CNV has been conducted through various methods, including slit lamp microscopy and laser-induced CNV formation in mice models. \n\nThe clinical phenotype of CNV in AMD provides valuable insights into the condition's progression and impact on vision.  CNV can be influenced by genetic variation that may be suppressed using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. \n\",8\n1875,PKP,\"The **PKP** refers to a specific event that occurred two weeks after another event.
