This information can be used as a reference standard for other diagnostic procedures and research. \n\",13\n2460,MSCS,\"The **MSCs** (Mesenchymal stem cells) are a type of stem cell that has been extensively studied for its potential therapeutic applications.  They are known to be recruited to sites of injury, where they can contribute to tissue repair and regeneration. In research studies, MSCs have been injected into the hindlimbs of rats to investigate their ability to promote angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels) and vascular density. These stem cells possess the unique ability to differentiate into various cell types, making them a promising subject for research on proliferation and treatment with EPAG.  MSCs are also being investigated as a potential tool for tissue repair due to their capacity to contribute to the formation of new tissues and organs. \n\",4\n129,CNV,\"**CNV**, or **chromosomal nevus**, is a serious medical condition characterized by abnormal cell growth, often leading to blindness. It can manifest as various eye conditions, including **choroidal neovascularization (CNV)**, which involves the abnormal growth of blood vessels in the retina. This condition can cause vision loss and necessitates treatment.  \n\nCNV is linked to oxidative stress and systemic inflammation, making it a complex medical condition that requires careful management. Research on CNV focuses on understanding its mechanisms and developing effective treatments, including potential therapies using DEX@INHANGs. Studies have been conducted in both humans and mice to investigate the effects of CNV treatment. \n\nCNV can be influenced by genetic variation, leading to changes in gene expression levels.  It is also associated with other eye conditions like cataracts and central nervous system vasculitis. The severity of CNV can vary significantly, impacting vision and potentially leading to serious ophthalmological consequences, especially in children. \n\",15\n4940,MSC-HYBRID-SIRNA NPS,,4\n4465,OGEL,Ogel is a company that developed the DEX@INHANGs nanogel system,3\n2551,FOLLOW-UP,Medical follow-up after MICE,1\n2850,BRUCH'S MEMBRANE,\"The **Bruch's membrane** is a membrane located in the eye that plays a crucial role in vision.
