This biological process plays a crucial role in various physiological functions, including tissue repair, wound healing, and tumor growth.  It is also a key factor in several pathological conditions, such as cancer progression, chronic liver diseases, and stroke recovery. \n\n**Key aspects of angiogenesis include:**\n\n* **Formation of new blood vessels:** Angiogenesis involves the development of new capillaries from existing vasculature, which is essential for tissue repair and growth.\n* **Tumor growth and metastasis:** Angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer and contributes to tumor growth, survival, and spread. \n* **Physiological processes:**  Angiogenesis is involved in several physiological processes like wound healing in diabetic patients, bone regeneration, and brain self-repair after injury (e.g., ICH).\n* **Therapeutic target for various diseases:** Angiogenesis is a therapeutic target for conditions such as ischemic tissue damage, cancer treatment, and ALI. \n* **Study of blood vessel development:**  The study of angiogenesis involves investigating the mechanisms and factors that regulate blood vessel formation in living organisms.\n\n**Contradictions and Resolutions:**\n\nWhile some descriptions mention the process being beneficial for healing and tissue repair, others highlight its role in tumor growth and metastasis. This contradiction can be resolved by understanding that angiogenesis is a complex process with both positive and negative implications depending on the context. \n\n\n**Further Research:**\n\nOngoing research focuses on understanding the mechanisms of angiogenesis to develop new therapies targeting this process.  For example, anti-angiogenic agents are being investigated for cancer treatment, aiming to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis by blocking the formation of new blood vessels. \n\",153\n595,DRUG,\"The drug liraglutide is being investigated as a potential treatment for both diabetes and certain types of cancer. \n\",2\n3165,MECHANICAL FORCES,Forces related to blood flow,2\n4421,M2-PHENOTYPE,Macrophage phenotype studied in the context of angiogenesis,2\n3680,ZEBRAFISH,\"The **zebrafish** is a widely used animal model in various scientific fields.
