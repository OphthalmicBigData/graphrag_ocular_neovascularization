It serves as a reference point for comparison, allowing researchers to assess the effects of treatments or interventions on other groups. \n\nThis group can be found in different contexts:\n\n* **Medical Studies:** In medical research, the CONTROL GROUP is often used in studies involving surgery (e.g., \"\"31 subjects without nasal/sinus inflammation, selected for surgery of pneumatized middle turbinate\"\") and wound healing. It represents a group that does not receive any treatment or intervention, allowing researchers to compare their outcomes with those who do. \n* **Animal Studies:** In animal studies, the CONTROL GROUP is used to compare the effects of treatments on different groups of animals (e.g., \"\"Group of mice not receiving treatment\"\" and \"\"Group of mice that received no treatment\"\"). This allows researchers to understand how specific interventions affect the health and behavior of animals.\n* **Clinical Trials:** In clinical trials, the CONTROL GROUP is often used as a baseline for comparison with the experimental group. It helps determine if any observed effects are due to the intervention or other factors (e.g., \"\"Group receiving placebo injection\"\" and \"\"Group used as a comparison in the study of wound healing\"\"). \n\nThe term **CONTROL GROUP** can also be used in research involving human subjects, such as when comparing the effects of different interventions on patients with specific conditions (e.g., \"\"Group of 10 pregnant women with no history of COVID-19\"\" and \"\"Group of patients in the study\"\").  It is important to note that the **CONTROL GROUP** plays a crucial role in research by providing a baseline for comparison, allowing researchers to understand the true effects of interventions or treatments.\n\n\n\",9\n3455,MC GROUP,The MC group is another specific experimental group in the study,3\n824,CONTROL,\"The **CONTROL** entity was used as a reference point in the study.
