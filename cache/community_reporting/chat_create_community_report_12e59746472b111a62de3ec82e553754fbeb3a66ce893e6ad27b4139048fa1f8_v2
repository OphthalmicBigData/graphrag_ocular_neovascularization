It refers to the phenomenon where cancer cells develop the ability to resist the effects of targeted therapies, such as those designed to inhibit specific pathways involved in tumor growth. This resistance can be attributed to several factors, including the development of mutations that alter drug targets or mechanisms of action, leading to reduced drug efficacy. Additionally, anti-angiogenic therapy, which aims to block blood vessel formation and starve tumors of nutrients, often faces limitations due to drug resistance.  Ultimately, cancer cells' ability to develop resistance to treatment is a complex process that hinders the effectiveness of therapies and necessitates further research into overcoming this challenge. \n\",3\n4989,TARGETED THERAPIES,Targeted therapies for breast cancer,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n837,UNICELLULAR TUMOR SPHEROIDS,MULTICELLULAR TUMOR SPHEROIDS,\"The two types of tumor spheroids can be used to study the mechanisms of cancer formation, development, and metastasis\",4\n2066,DRUG RESISTANCE,TARGETED THERAPIES,\"Drug resistance to targeted therapies for breast cancer\nTargeted therapies are used to treat drug resistance in breast cancer\",4\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
