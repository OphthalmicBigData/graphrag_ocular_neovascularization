It plays a crucial role in various physiological functions, including tissue repair, perfusion of ischemic areas, and wound healing.  \n\nThis process can occur in several contexts: \n\n* **Eye:** Neovascularization is abnormal blood vessel growth in the eye, often associated with conditions like diabetic retinopathy or age-related macular degeneration.\n* **Body:** Neovascularization occurs throughout the body as a response to ischemia (lack of blood flow), contributing to plaque vulnerability and potentially serving as a treatment option for certain diseases. \n* **Adipose Tissue:**  Neovascularization can also occur in adipose tissue, where new blood vessels form in response to specific stimuli.\n\nWhile neovascularization is essential for healthy tissue repair and perfusion, uncontrolled growth of blood vessels can lead to complications like retinal detachment or even contribute to the recurrence of certain conditions like CSDH (Congenital Subretinal Hemorrhage). \n\n\nIt's important to note that neovascularization can be a double-edged sword. While it plays a vital role in tissue repair and perfusion, uncontrolled growth can also lead to problems such as plaque vulnerability and retinal detachment.  \n\",13\n3991,BRAIN MICROVASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL CELLS,Cells in the brain that form blood vessels,2\n44,ADHESION TYPE,,1\n727,CONTRALATERAL MIDDLE MENINGEAL ARTERY,,1\n5091,DISORDERS OF THE INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT,,1\n3983,MIR-491-5P,A microRNA,12\n3984,NEUROLOGICAL SEVERITY SCORES,Scores used to measure neurological damage,1\n2961,MORRIS WATER MAZE TEST,\"The **Morris Water Maze Test** is a widely used assessment tool for evaluating spatial memory and learning in rodents.
