It plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including the development of cancer, progression of Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV), and immune response.  Inflammation can be triggered by stem cell secretome in diabetic rats, leading to tissue damage. This process involves the migration of monocytes and is mentioned as a factor in the context of Idiopathic Central Serous Retinopathy (iCNV).
