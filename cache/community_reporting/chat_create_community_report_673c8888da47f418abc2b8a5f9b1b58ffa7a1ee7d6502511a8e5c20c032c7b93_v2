It plays a crucial role in various physiological functions, including tissue repair, perfusion of ischemic areas, and wound healing.  \n\nThis process can occur in several contexts: \n\n* **Eye:** Neovascularization is abnormal blood vessel growth in the eye, often associated with conditions like diabetic retinopathy or age-related macular degeneration.\n* **Body:** Neovascularization occurs throughout the body as a response to ischemia (lack of blood flow), contributing to plaque vulnerability and potentially serving as a treatment option for certain diseases. \n* **Adipose Tissue:**  Neovascularization can also occur in adipose tissue, where new blood vessels form in response to specific stimuli.\n\nWhile neovascularization is essential for healthy tissue repair and perfusion, uncontrolled growth of blood vessels can lead to complications like retinal detachment or even contribute to the recurrence of certain conditions like CSDH (Congenital Subretinal Hemorrhage). \n\n\nIt's important to note that neovascularization can be a double-edged sword. While it plays a vital role in tissue repair and perfusion, uncontrolled growth can also lead to problems such as plaque vulnerability and retinal detachment.  \n\",14\n44,ADHESION TYPE,,1\n727,CONTRALATERAL MIDDLE MENINGEAL ARTERY,,1\n5213,DISORDERS OF THE INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT,,1\n45,RETINAL VASCULAR PLEXUS,The network of blood vessels in the retina,3\n46,TRACTION TYPE,A type of retinal detachment,3\n48,ACTIVE NEOVASCULARIZATION,,2\n47,MUSHROOM TYPE,Another type of retinal detachment,3\n49,FAINTLY LEAKY NEOVASCULARIZATION,,2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n1720,BRAIN MICROVASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL CELLS,NEOVASCULARIZATION,Downregulation of miR-491-5p promotes neovascularization,16\n17,NEOVASCULARIZATION,ADHESION TYPE,Neovascularization of the adhesion type was identified in 9 out of 17 eyes,15\n219,NEOVASCULARIZATION,CONTRALATERAL MIDDLE MENINGEAL ARTERY,Uncommon mechanism for recurrence of CSDH occurs through neovascularization of the contralateral middle meningeal artery,15\n2325,NEOVASCULARIZATION,DISORDERS OF THE INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT,Disorders of the internal environment can affect neovascularization,15\n18,RETINAL VASCULAR PLEXUS,TRACTION TYPE,The traction type is a part of the retinal vascular plexus,6\n21,TRACTION TYPE,ACTIVE NEOVASCULARIZATION,A traction type detachment is associated with active neovascularization,5\n23,MUSHROOM TYPE,FAINTLY LEAKY NEOVASCULARIZATION,A mushroom type detachment is associated with faintly leaky neovascularization,5\n25,ACTIVE NEOVASCULARIZATION,FAINTLY LEAKY NEOVASCULARIZATION,Active and faintly leaky neovascularization are different states of the same process,4\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
