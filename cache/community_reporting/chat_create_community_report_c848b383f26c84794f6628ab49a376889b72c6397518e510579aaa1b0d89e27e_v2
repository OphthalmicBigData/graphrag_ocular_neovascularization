It is also the subject of research, as indicated in the provided descriptions. \n\",4\n159,NEOVASCULARIZATION,\"**Neovascularization** is a process where new blood vessels form, often leading to complications in various conditions.  It can occur in the **eye**, contributing to vision loss in diseases like **ocular neovascularization** which causes irreversible blindness. In the context of **cancer treatment**, neovascularization is a key target as it can contribute to tumor growth and spread. It also plays a role in **corneal allograft rejection**, where new blood vessels form, leading to inflammation and rejection.  Neovascularization can be observed in the **posterior pole** of the eye and is associated with **new blood vessel formation** in the retina. This process can also contribute to the spread of **intracranial calcifications (ICC)**. \n\",16\n5136,IL-4-LOADED IMPLANTS,,4\n579,OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY ANGIOLOGY,\"**Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA)** is a technique used to visualize the structure and function of blood vessels.
