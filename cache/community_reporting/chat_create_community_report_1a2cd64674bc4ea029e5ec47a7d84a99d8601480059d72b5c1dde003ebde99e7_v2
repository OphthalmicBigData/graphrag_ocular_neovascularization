It involves separating proteins based on their size using gel electrophoresis, followed by transferring the separated proteins to a membrane.  Antibodies specific to the target protein are then applied to the membrane, allowing for detection of the protein's presence through a colorimetric or chemiluminescent reaction. This technique is also used to detect changes in protein expression levels and has applications in various fields such as research and diagnostics. \n\",2\n3513,LXA4,Bioactive lipid mediator,6\n2725,CORNEAL OPACITY,\"**Corneal opacity** is a condition affecting the **cornea**, characterized by cloudiness or haziness.
