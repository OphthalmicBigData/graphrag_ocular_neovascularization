It is involved in various biological processes, including cell growth and survival, tumor development, and treatment for certain diseases. \n\nVEGF acts as a signaling molecule that promotes angiogenesis by stimulating angiogenic transcription factors.  It's highly expressed in conditions like proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and has been studied as a potential therapeutic target. VEGF levels can be affected by various factors, including hypoxia, sugar intake, and treatment with certain medications. \n\nResearch indicates that VEGF is involved in the development of tumors and plays a role in tumor growth.  It's also used in bone reconstruction procedures due to its ability to stimulate angiogenesis.  VEGF has been observed in the CNV group, suggesting its involvement in various pathological conditions.\n\n\n**Key points:**\n* **Function:** Promotes angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels)\n* **Role:** Involved in cell growth and survival, tumor development, PDR treatment \n* **Expression:** Highly expressed in certain conditions like PDR and diabetic rats\n* **Treatment:**  Used as a drug for various diseases.\n\n\n\",50\n840,NF-ΚB,\"The **NF-κB** protein plays a crucial role in both inflammation and the immune response.
