It is a key factor in the development of conditions like central venous insufficiency (CNV) and plays a role in neovascularization, particularly in response to ischemia.  Inflammation can be categorized into different grades, with lower grades observed in groups 1 and 2. The body's inflammatory response is crucial for healing and fighting infection. It is also a part of the pathogenesis of ischemia, where it contributes to tissue damage.  Various models have been used to study anti-inflammatory effects, including those involving inflammation itself. Inflammation can manifest in different ways, such as heart muscle inflammation or retinal inflammation caused by high blood sugar levels.
