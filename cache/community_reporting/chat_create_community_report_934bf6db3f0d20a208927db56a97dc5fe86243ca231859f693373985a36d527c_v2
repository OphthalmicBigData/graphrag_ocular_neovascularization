This process is crucial for various physiological functions, including wound healing, tissue development, and tumor growth.  It involves a complex interplay of cellular processes, such as cell proliferation and vascular development. \n\n**Key aspects of neovascularization include:**\n\n* **Cell Proliferation:** ATG7, a protein involved in angiogenesis, plays a vital role in promoting cell division and growth, which are essential for creating new blood vessels.\n* **Vascular Development:**  Neovascularization contributes to the formation of new blood vessel structures during embryonic development and wound healing. \n* **Tumorigenesis:** Neovascularization is also implicated in tumor growth and progression, as it facilitates the delivery of nutrients and oxygen to cancerous cells.\n\n**Understanding neovascularization is crucial for addressing various medical conditions.**  For example, neovascularization plays a significant role in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), where new blood vessels form abnormally in the eye, leading to vision loss. \n\n\nThis summary provides a comprehensive overview of neovascularization by highlighting its key aspects and their relevance across different contexts. \n\",20\n2457,VALVES,\"The **valves** are essential components of the heart, playing a crucial role in regulating blood flow.  Specifically, they are the heart valves that control the direction and pressure of blood flow through the heart. \n\",7\n1430,VASCULAR SYSTEM,\"The **vascular system** is a network of blood vessels in the human body. This complex system plays a crucial role in delivering nutrients and oxygen to cells throughout the body, while also transporting waste products away for removal.  Furthermore, the vascular system is essential for the inflammatory response during wound healing, where it helps deliver immune cells and fluids to the injured area. \n\",1\n2467,REGURGITATION,,1\n2468,HEART VALVE,The heart valve is the organ in the body that regulates blood flow,1\n2469,CHRONIC VALVE DISEASE,A long-term condition affecting the heart valve,1\n3208,ACTIVATED MONOCYTES,,1\n4162,RETINAL CAPILLARY LEAKAGE,A condition in the eye,1\n88,DIABETIC RETINOPATHY,\"**Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)** is a complication of diabetes that affects the retina. It can lead to vision loss and is a major cause of blindness. DR is a sight-threatening disease, often classified as an ocular neovascular disease, characterized by abnormal blood vessel growth in the retina.  It can also be categorized as proliferative retinopathy. \n\",4\n805,IL-6,\"The **IL-6** cytokine is a type of inflammatory cytokine that plays a role in inflammation. It is involved in the body's response to injury and infection, with its levels increasing after laser injury.  \n\",2\n1761,HEART,\"The **heart** is a vital organ in the human body, located in the chest cavity. It is responsible for pumping blood throughout the body.  A unique aspect of research is that scientists have created an ex vivo model using the heart of a mouse to study its function and development. \n\",3\n2293,MACULAR NEOVASCULARIZATION,\"**Macular Neovascularization (MN)** is a condition that affects the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp vision.  It involves abnormal blood vessel growth in the macula, which can lead to vision loss. This condition is often associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), where new blood vessels form abnormally and leak fluid or blood, damaging the macula. The study of MN focuses on understanding the morphological changes that occur in the macula during this process. \n\",8\n3012,MYOPIC MACULAR DEGENERATION,A type of macular degeneration,2\n444,GA,\"**Geographic Atrophy (GA)** is a condition characterized by the progressive loss of retinal tissue, leading to vision impairment.
