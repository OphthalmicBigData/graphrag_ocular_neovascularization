It involves various cellular and molecular changes, including increased blood flow, immune cell recruitment, and release of inflammatory mediators. Inflammation can be triggered by both internal factors like infections and external factors like trauma.  Inflammation is linked to neovascularization in response to injury and ischemia, and it is a key factor in the development of conditions such as central vein occlusion (CNV). \n\nWhile inflammation grades were lower in groups 1 and 2, the process itself is essential for tissue repair and immune responses. Inflammation models have been used to study anti-inflammatory effects, with research focusing on substances like RsSO.  Inflammation can manifest in various locations, including the heart muscle (myocarditis) and the retina (diabetic retinopathy). It's a crucial part of the body's response to injury or infection, and its understanding is vital for treating various diseases. \n\",10\n1651,ANGIOGENIC STRUCTURE,Structure that promotes blood vessel growth,2\n5576,TENDINOPATHIC INJURIES,Injuries to tendons,2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n530,GINGER,DIABETIC RETINOPATHY,Ginger can help improve diabetic retinopathy by inhibiting the expression of e/iNOS and G6PDH,15\n215,Α-ZINGIBERENE,INFLAMMATION,α-zingiberene may help treat inflammation,13\n575,ANGIOGENIC STRUCTURE,INFLAMMATION,Inflammation can affect angiogenic structure,12\n2542,TENDINOPATHIC INJURIES,INFLAMMATION,Tendinopathic injuries are associated with inflammation,12\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
