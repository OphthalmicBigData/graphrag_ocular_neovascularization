This movement can be observed in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions, such as cancer development.  In the context of cancer, invasion is a key step in metastasis, where cancerous cells break away from their primary tumor site and spread to other parts of the body. \n\",2\n170,ANTI-ANGIOGENIC DRUGS,,2\n1003,TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT,\"The **tumor microenvironment (TME)** encompasses the area surrounding a tumor, including the cells and molecules that interact with each other and the body's immune system. This complex ecosystem influences tumor growth, progression, and response to treatment.  It is characterized by hypoxia (low oxygen levels), interactions between tumor cells and immune cells, and the influence of various factors like cytokines and extracellular matrix components. The TME plays a crucial role in shaping the tumor's behavior and can be both beneficial and detrimental to its development. \n\",9\n48,COLORECTAL CANCER,\"Colorectal cancer is a type of cancer affecting the gastrointestinal tract.
