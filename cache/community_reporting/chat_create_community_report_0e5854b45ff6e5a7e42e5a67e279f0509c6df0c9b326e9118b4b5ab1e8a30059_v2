This condition can lead to vision loss and is often studied as a model for age-related macular degeneration.  CNV can result from various factors, including genetic mutations, cancer, or even laser treatment. It involves changes in gene expression, cellular processes, and blood vessel size, impacting angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels). CNV has been observed in both humans and mice, with the latter being used to study its development and potential treatments.  Research on CNV focuses on understanding its mechanisms and developing therapies for vision loss associated with this condition. \n\",23\n754,PD,\"Vascular perfusion density, a measure of blood flow\",1\n755,VLD,\"Vessel length density, a measure of vessel size\",1\n932,HUMAN PATHOLOGY,,1\n2036,SEVENTH DAY,,1\n2188,TEMPORAL PARAFOVEA,Location on the eye where a lesion was found,1\n2189,TEMPORAL PERIPHERY,Location on the eye where a lesion was found,1\n3155,ANTI-ROBO1/2,,1\n3681,LGALS3-SIRNA INJECTION,,1\n4212,9 MMHG,Intraocular pressure measured 9 mmHg,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n168,CNV,SUBRETINAL FIBROSIS,CNV and subretinal fibrosis are related,27\n311,CNV,PD,Vascular perfusion density is measured in relation to CNV,24\n312,CNV,VLD,Vessel length density is measured in relation to CNV,24\n422,HUMAN PATHOLOGY,CNV,\"CNV is a treatable condition that can be observed in humans with retinal degeneration)<|COMPLETE|> You are absolutely right!
