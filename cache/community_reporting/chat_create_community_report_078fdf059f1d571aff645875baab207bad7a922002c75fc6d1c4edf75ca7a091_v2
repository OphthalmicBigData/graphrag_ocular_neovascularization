This process, essential for normal development, tissue repair, and wound healing, also plays a crucial role in tumor growth and metastasis. Angiogenesis involves the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones or by sprouting new vessels from existing ones. It is a key hallmark of tumors and is targeted by therapies aimed at inhibiting its progression.  Angiogenesis is regulated by various factors, including the circadian clock, and can be inhibited by certain substances like saponins. \n\nThe process of angiogenesis is studied extensively in research, particularly in the context of VCE-005.1, a potential treatment for cancer. It is also a significant factor in cardiovascular disease (CVD) development and vascular pathologies.  Angiogenesis is essential for tissue growth and repair, including wound healing, and plays a vital role in tumor growth and metastasis. \n\",133\n533,PHYSIOLOGY,,1\n534,PATHOLOGY,,1\n385,STEM CELL,\"Cell-free, with low immunogenicity and no potential tumourigenicity\",1\n815,MTOR SIGNALING PATHWAYS,A set of biochemical processes involved in cell growth and survival,1\n907,EPC FUNCTION,Function of the endothelium in response to tissue ischemia,1\n1395,LUNG TUMOR,Lung tumors are stimulated by angiogenesis,1\n2126,NON-TUMOR CELL EVS,,1\n2728,IMMUNE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE,The immune system's response to injury and infection,1\n2808,LIQUID-LIQUID PHASE SEPARATION,New concept in cellular functions and diseases,1\n2809,\"1,6-HEXANE DIOL\",,1\n3038,TFPI-2 OVEREXPRESSION,,1\n3552,DISEASE PROGRESSION,Disease progression,1\n3553,ENDOTHELIAL CELL ANERGY,A type of cell that can be targeted with anti-angiogenic therapies,1\n3554,ANGIOCRINE SIGNALS,Signals that promote or inhibit angiogenesis,1\n3555,ENDOTHELIAL PLASTICITY,A type of cell that can be targeted with anti-angiogenic therapies,1\n3556,VESSEL NORMALIZATION,Process of restoring normal blood vessel function,1\n3719,INO,A chemical compound promoting angiogenesis,1\n3797,TUMORS,Abnormal growths of tissue,1\n3986,SCANDIUM-44,Radiometal for PET imaging,1\n4063,OVERLOAD TRAINING,Type of training that can inhibit muscle adaptation,1\n4452,DEFICIENCY,,1\n4508,SENILE OSTEOOPOROTIC FRACTURE,Osteoporosis in the elderly,1\n4685,22 STUDIES,,1\n870,SENESCENCE,Senescence is a process of aging that leads to cell death,1\n4972,ABERRANT,,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n190,ANGIOGENESIS,PHYSIOLOGY,Angiogenesis is a physiological process,134\n191,ANGIOGENESIS,PATHOLOGY,Angiogenesis is also involved in pathological processes,134\n305,STEM CELL,ANGIOGENESIS,\"Stem cells can affect angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels\",134\n306,ANGIOGENESIS,MTOR SIGNALING PATHWAYS,Modulating mTOR signaling pathways can affect stem cell's angiogenic properties,134\n362,ANGIOGENESIS,EPC FUNCTION,The EPC function is involved in angiogenesis,134\n539,LUNG TUMOR,ANGIOGENESIS,Lung tumors stimulate angiogenesis,134\n828,NON-TUMOR CELL EVS,ANGIOGENESIS,Non-tumor cell EVs promote angiogenesis,134\n1041,IMMUNE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE,ANGIOGENESIS,osseointegration,134\n1066,ANGIOGENESIS,LIQUID-LIQUID PHASE SEPARATION,LLPS may play a role in angiogenesis,134\n1067,ANGIOGENESIS,\"1,6-HEXANE DIOL\",\"1,6-hexanediol is a chemical that could be involved in angiogenesis\",134\n1129,ANGIOGENESIS,TFPI-2 OVEREXPRESSION,TFPI-2 overexpression inhibits angiogenesis in keratinocytes,134\n1360,ANGIOGENESIS,DISEASE PROGRESSION,\"Angiogenesis is a process that can stabilize, reverse, or halt disease progression\",134\n1361,ANGIOGENESIS,ENDOTHELIAL CELL ANERGY,Angiogenesis and endothelial cell anergy are related processes,134\n1363,ANGIOGENESIS,ANGIOCRINE SIGNALS,Angiocrine signals can influence angiogenesis,134\n1364,ANGIOGENESIS,ENDOTHELIAL PLASTICITY,Endothelial plasticity can be targeted with anti-angiogenic therapies,134\n1365,ANGIOGENESIS,VESSEL NORMALIZATION,Vessel normalization is a process that can be affected by angiogenesis,134\n1479,INO,ANGIOGENESIS,\"iNO promotes angiogenesis in the developing white matter and cortex\niNO effects on angiogenesis are mimicked by circulating nitrate/nitrite\",134\n1547,ANGIOGENESIS,TUMORS,\"Angiogenesis is a process that can contribute to tumor growth\nAngiogenesis is important for the growth of tumors\",134\n1643,SCANDIUM-44,ANGIOGENESIS,Scandium-44 is a radiometal used in the development of angiogenesis-directed radiopharmaceuticals,134\n1678,ANGIOGENESIS,OVERLOAD TRAINING,Overload training can inhibit muscle adaptation and angiogenesis,134\n1871,ANGIOGENESIS,DEFICIENCY,Deficiency impairs angiogenesis,134\n1895,ANGIOGENESIS,SENILE OSTEOOPOROTIC FRACTURE,A new strategy for treating senile osteoporotic fractures,134\n2011,ANGIOGENESIS,22 STUDIES,22 studies were reviewed to determine the effect of PTX on angiogenesis,134\n2053,SENESCENCE,ANGIOGENESIS,Senescence is associated with a decline in angiogenesis,134\n2139,ANGIOGENESIS,ABERRANT,Abnormal angiogenesis can contribute to the development of diseases like Moyamoya,134\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
