This process can occur in various locations, including the retina, brain, and even tumors. It's characterized by increased blood vessel growth and can be either beneficial or detrimental depending on the context. \n\nWhile neovascularization can contribute to healthy tissue repair and healing processes, it can also lead to vision loss when occurring in the retina (e.g., age-related macular degeneration).  Neovascularization is a key factor in tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. It's essential for understanding how tumors progress and can be targeted by therapies aimed at inhibiting this process. \n\nThe descriptions highlight that neovascularization can occur as part of the healing process, specifically in the study group, or even under specific conditions like high-glucose levels.  It is also mentioned to be a process that occurs in the body as part of the healing process and can be inhibited by certain treatments.\n\n\n\",16\n4413,ANTI-EMP2 AB,\"The **ANTI-EMP2 AB** is an antibody used in the treatment of various conditions.
