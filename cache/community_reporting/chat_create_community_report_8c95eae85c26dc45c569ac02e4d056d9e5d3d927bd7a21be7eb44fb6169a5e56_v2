It acts as a growth factor, promoting both blood vessel growth and tissue repair. VEGF is involved in various biological processes, including cell survival, bone regeneration, tumor growth, and wound healing.  \n\nIt's a key signaling molecule for angiogenesis, stimulating blood vessel formation.  VEGF expression is often increased in response to treatments like PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma) treatment. While its role in angiogenesis is well-established, there are some paradoxical effects observed, such as paradoxical bone loss associated with VEGF stimulation of blood vessel growth. \n\nStudies have shown that decreased levels of VEGF are linked to certain conditions, and it has been identified as a potential biomarker for coronary collateral establishment.  Furthermore, VEGF's role in angiogenesis is often investigated in the context of tumor growth and its inhibition by BJ (likely referring to a specific cell line or treatment) has been studied. \n\",47\n3792,TVBD-CD105,Moderate positive correlation with TVBD-CD105,2\n1570,RT-PCR,\"The **RT-PCR** method is a technique used to detect the expression levels of specific mRNAs, including VEGFA, IGF1, and ANGPT2.
