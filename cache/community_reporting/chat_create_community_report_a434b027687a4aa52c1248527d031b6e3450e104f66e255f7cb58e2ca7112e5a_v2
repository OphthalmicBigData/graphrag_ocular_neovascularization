This essential process plays a critical role in various physiological functions, including tissue regeneration, wound healing, tumor growth, and even heart function restoration after myocardial infarction. \n\nIt involves the intricate interplay of multiple factors, including the recruitment of endothelial cells to form new capillaries, the release of signaling molecules like VEGF, and the remodeling of existing blood vessels.  Angiogenesis is a key driver of tumor progression, as it facilitates nutrient supply and oxygenation for cancerous cells. It also contributes to fibrosis, osteoarthritis, and other pathological conditions. \n\nResearch on angiogenesis has yielded significant insights into its regulation and potential therapeutic applications. Strategies targeting angiogenesis are being explored for treating ischemic stroke, diabetic wounds, and various cancers.  The process is a subject of ongoing research, with studies focusing on the specific molecules involved in angiogenesis and their impact on tumor growth and metastasis.\n\n\n\",159\n2224,MSC,\"The **MSC** (Mesenchymal Stem Cell) is a type of stem cell known as a **stem cell**.
