It serves as a model for understanding and investigating this process. \n\",5\n682,DFU,\"The **DFU** is a rat model used to study the effects of GDF-10 on wound healing, specifically in the context of deep vein ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers.  It is also considered a disease entity and a group of cells studied.  Furthermore, DFU can be classified as a type of skin lesion. \n\",6\n683,FIBROBLASTS,\"**Fibroblasts** are cells involved in various biological processes, including tissue repair, development, and wound healing.  They contribute to the formation of skin and other tissues, and can become proangiogenic CAFs (cancer-associated fibroblasts). Fibroblasts produce collagen and other proteins that play a crucial role in tissue repair and growth. They are essential for wound healing by providing structural support and promoting cell migration. \n\",6\n70,CELLS,\"**Cells** are the fundamental building blocks of all living organisms. They form the basic unit of life and are essential for various biological processes.  Cells can exist in a confluent state, meaning they are densely packed together, and are often used in research settings to study cellular behavior and function. These cells are also found within the diabetic wound microenvironment, highlighting their role in tissue repair and regeneration. Importantly, living cells that can be studied in vitro (outside of a living organism) provide valuable tools for understanding cell biology and disease mechanisms. \n\",5\n684,MYOFIBROBLASTS,Myofibroblasts are a type of fibroblast that contribute to wound healing,2\n687,SECRETORY,,2\n688,ANGIOSTATIC,,2\n5366,MOYAMOYA,Moyamoya disease patients treated in the study,3\n5355,ENDOTHELIALIZATION,\"The **endothelialization** process is the lining of the inner surface of blood vessels with specialized cells called endothelial cells.

It plays a crucial role in providing structural support, influencing cell behavior, and facilitating various biological processes.  Specifically, the ECM is involved in endothelialization, where it helps cells lining blood vessels attach to each other. The ECM also serves as a structure that provides clues for angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels.
