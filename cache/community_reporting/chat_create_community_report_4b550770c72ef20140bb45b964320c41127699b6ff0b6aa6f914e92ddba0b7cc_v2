It plays a crucial role in angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation. These cells are commonly studied in research settings. \n\",7\n1662,TMEM16A,\"The **TMEM16A** gene plays a significant role in various biological processes. It has been identified as a potential target for understanding and treating **ischemic heart disease**.  Research suggests that TMEM16A is involved in the development of ischemic heart disease, likely through its influence on **angiogenesis**, the formation of new blood vessels. Additionally, TMEM16A protein contributes to cell function and development. \n\",5\n1904,NF-KB-P65,A protein complex that regulates the release of IL-8,2\n2577,IFI30,\"The **IFI30** protein plays a role in the immune response. It is also a human gene that shares similarities with the **zebrafish IFI30** gene. \n\",5\n2579,CVP,\"The **CVP** (Central Venous Pressure) is a physiological measurement that refers to the pressure of blood within the central veins. It is also a specific area where **Ifi30** plays a crucial role in sprouting angiogenesis.  Specifically, **Ifi30** is required for the process of angiogenesis, which involves the formation of new blood vessels, and its presence is essential for successful sprouting in this context. \n\",4\n823,MACROPHAGES,\"**Macrophages** are immune cells that play a crucial role in various physiological processes, including the immune response, inflammation, and tissue repair.  They are essential components of the immune system, engulfing and destroying pathogens as part of their function.  Furthermore, macrophages contribute to bone formation and repair, angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels), and regulate the development of age-related macular degeneration.  Their immunoregulatory effects influence the progression of various diseases, including those related to CNV (choroidal neovascularization).  Macrophages are also involved in HIF signaling pathways, highlighting their complex role in cellular processes. \n\",3\n1664,EC SPHEROIDS SPROUTING,,1\n1558,IMMUNE RESPONSE,Immune response is a part of the healing process,1\n1902,ALDH1A1,\"The **ALDH1A1** gene is a cytosolic enzyme that plays a crucial role in detoxification, helping cells resist the effects of chemotherapy.
