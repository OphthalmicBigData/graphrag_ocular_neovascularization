This allows for direct comparison with experimental groups that receive specific interventions.\n* **Human Clinical Trials:** The Control Group in human studies typically consists of individuals receiving standard care or no intervention, serving as a reference point against which the effects of new treatments are measured. \n* **Biological Research:**  The Control Group can also be used to compare the behavior or characteristics of cells or organisms under specific conditions. This group allows researchers to isolate and study the impact of particular factors on the subject being investigated.\n\nIn essence, the Control Group is a vital component in scientific research, providing a standard for comparison and ensuring that observed effects are truly attributable to the intervention or treatment being studied. \n\",10\n986,VEGETE,\"VEGF is a protein involved in blood vessel growth, which is important for tumor growth\",2\n2965,FLAP SURGERY,Surgical procedure for wound closure,2\n1129,THERAPY GROUPS,Groups that received therapy in the study,1\n4479,PCOLCE1<SUP>-/-</SUP> MICE,,1\n62,TREATMENT GROUPS,,2\n4846,HEMORRHAGIC MASTITIS,A disease that causes economic losses in dairy industry,3\n4847,DAIRY INDUSTRY,The industry affected by HM,1\n4848,HOLSTEIN COWS,Type of cow used for milk production,1\n4850,C GROUP,The C group is a group in an experiment,2\n4851,HM GROUP,The HM group is a group in an experiment,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n2096,MAMMARY GLANDS,CONTROL GROUP,Control group used for comparison of healthy cows,13\n1134,CONTROL GROUP,VEGETE,\"VEGF expression in the control group was significantly higher than the control group\nThe VEGF expression in the control group was significantly higher than the control group\",12\n1166,CONTROL GROUP,FLAP SURGERY,The control group may be treated with metformin to compare the effects of metformin on flap survival,12\n380,CONTROL GROUP,THERAPY GROUPS,The control group and therapy groups were compared in the study,11\n1870,PCOLCE1<SUP>-/-</SUP> MICE,CONTROL GROUP,Mice with the Pcolce1 gene knocked out were compared to a control group of mice,11\n1135,TREATMENT GROUPS,VEGETE,The VEGF expression in the treatment groups was significantly higher than controls,4\n2092,HEMORRHAGIC MASTITIS,DAIRY INDUSTRY,HM causes economic losses in dairy industry,4\n2095,HOLSTEIN COWS,MAMMARY GLANDS,Holstein cows have mammary glands where HM occurs,4\n2098,C GROUP,HM GROUP,The HM group is a group in an experiment that was compared to the C group,3\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
