This information can be applied to develop new therapies for diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. Mice are also commonly used to study wound healing, a process that involves the formation of new tissue after an injury. Understanding how wounds heal in mice can help researchers develop better treatments for human wounds. Additionally, mice are often used to model human diseases, allowing researchers to test potential treatments before they are tested on humans.
