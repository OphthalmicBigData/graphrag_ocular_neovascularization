PE is characterized by high blood pressure and protein in the urine, often occurring during pregnancy or after delivery. This condition can lead to complications for both mother and fetus. Impaired uterine spiral artery remodeling contributes to these complications, as it disrupts normal blood flow to the placenta, potentially leading to fetal growth restriction and preterm labor.
