This field of study investigates various aspects of wound healing, including cell migration, invasion, and the use of functional hydrogels for accelerated healing.  It is a crucial process that occurs after injury, aiming to restore functionality and minimize disfiguring scars. Researchers have explored this process in both mice models and human studies, particularly focusing on individuals with diabetes who experience altered wound healing. The study aims to develop innovative methods like using exosomes to enhance wound healing. \n\",30\n167,VPA-EXO,A substance used to promote angiogenesis and inflammation in cell models,2\n3841,ANERGIOGENESIS,Process involved in wound healing and associated with angiogenic therapy,2\n2946,MICRONEEDLE,A small needle used to deliver medication,1\n2947,BIPHASIC,Drug delivery system with two phases,1\n3027,NANOCOMPOSITE HYDROGEL,A material used for wound dressings,1\n3950,ASCS,\"The **ASCS** (abbreviation for a specific cell culture source) is a source of cells that are known to produce extracellular vesicles (EVs).
