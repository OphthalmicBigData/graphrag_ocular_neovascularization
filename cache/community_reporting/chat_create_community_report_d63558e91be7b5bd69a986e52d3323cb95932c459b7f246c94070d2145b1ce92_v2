It involves abnormal growth of blood vessels in the choroid, a layer of tissue behind the retina. CNV can lead to vision loss and requires treatment with intravitreal injections or other medications.  It can be detected early in the study period and diagnosed using optical coherence tomography (OCT) or OCT angiography (OCTA). \n\nCNV is often associated with conditions like age-related macular degeneration (AMD), but it can also occur independently. It can cause exudative recurrence, meaning vision loss may return after treatment.  The condition can be identified by changes in the volume of cells in the eye and choroidal abnormalities measured using OCT. CNV is a genetic model used to study eye diseases and can be detected by specific genetic variations that can be followed up on. \n\nCNV is a type of retinal disease, and its presence can lead to various complications like Cataract Neuropathy Vision Loss.  It can also be diagnosed in patients with certain conditions such as MFC (multifocal choroiditis). The study of CNV has been crucial for understanding the mechanisms of vision loss and developing new treatments. \n\",71\n2752,MEWDS-LIKE PHENOTYPES,,2\n4551,LE,The LE is a location where early CNV activation signs could be detected,2\n1399,HM,Macular Hemorrhage,2\n4828,LMM,Another subject group in the study,2\n262,BVMD,,1\n263,ARB,,1\n265,EXUDATIVE CNV,Exudative CNV is a type of CNV that causes fluid build-up in the eye,1\n269,HYPERREFLECTIVE MATERIALS,,1\n270,BVMD EYES,,1\n271,ARB EYES,,1\n693,ANGIOGENIC,\"The **angiogenic** process refers to the formation of new blood vessels, also known as angiogenesis.
