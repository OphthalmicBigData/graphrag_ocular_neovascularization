This research highlights the potential of PCL as a key material for developing advanced wound care solutions.\",\n            \"detailed_explanation\": \"PCL's biocompatibility stems from its ability to be degraded by the body, minimizing the risk of rejection. Its porous structure allows cells to infiltrate and grow within it, creating a supportive environment for tissue regeneration.  Furthermore, PCL's unique properties allow it to mimic the natural extracellular matrix (ECM), which is essential for cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation.
