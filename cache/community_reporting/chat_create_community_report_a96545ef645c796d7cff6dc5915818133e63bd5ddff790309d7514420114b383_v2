CNV can occur after anti-VEGF therapy in some cases, making it a late-stage complication in Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD).  It is often difficult to diagnose with traditional imaging techniques like fluorescein angiography. \n\nCNV is considered an eye condition and is a significant pathological change associated with wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). It can be further categorized as a specific type of eye disease, impacting the central vision of the eye.
