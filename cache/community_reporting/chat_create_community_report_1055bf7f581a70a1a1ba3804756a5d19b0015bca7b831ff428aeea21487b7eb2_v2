This intricate process plays a critical role in various physiological functions, including tissue development, wound healing, and tumor growth. \n\n**Key aspects of angiogenesis include:**\n\n* **Oxygen and nutrient supply:** Angiogenesis provides oxygen and nutrients to tissues, essential for their survival and function.\n* **Embryonic development:**  Angiogenesis is crucial during embryonic development, enabling the formation of blood vessels that support fetal growth.\n* **Tissue repair:** Angiogenesis promotes wound healing by supplying cells with necessary resources for regeneration. \n* **Tumor progression:** Angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer and contributes to tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance.  It allows tumors to access oxygen, nutrients, and growth factors, fueling their expansion.\n* **Disease progression:** Angiogenesis plays a role in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic wounds, and pancreatic cancer. \n\n**Angiogenesis is also being investigated for its potential in regenerative medicine.** For example, it can be enhanced to promote wound healing in patients with diabetes or to improve myocardial healing following ischemia.  \n\n**Research on angiogenesis:**\n\n* **Methods of evaluation:** Techniques and methods for evaluating angiogenesis are constantly evolving, including measuring new blood vessel formation (e.g., using rat models) and assessing its impact on disease progression.\n* **Mechanisms of action:** The mechanisms underlying angiogenesis are complex and involve various factors like stem cell secretome, MOF nanozymes, and the influence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. \n\n**Overall, understanding the intricacies of angiogenesis is crucial for developing effective treatments for a wide range of diseases.**  It holds immense potential in both research and clinical settings to improve tissue repair, combat cancer, and develop novel therapeutic strategies. \n\",114\n819,IPSCS-DERIVED EXOSOMES,,2\n1100,IRE1,An enzyme involved in the unfolded protein response,2\n1101,XBP1,A transcription factor involved in the unfolded protein response,2\n1102,PERK,An enzyme involved in the unfolded protein response,2\n2588,HDL,High Density Lipoprotein,2\n2924,WMH,\"**White matter hyperintensity (WMH)** is a condition characterized by abnormal signal intensity on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain.
