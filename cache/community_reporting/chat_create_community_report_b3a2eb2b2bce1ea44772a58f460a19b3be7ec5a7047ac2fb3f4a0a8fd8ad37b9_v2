This process, often triggered by various ocular insults, can lead to vision loss. CNV can be caused by conditions like cataracts or age-related macular degeneration, and it is often treated with gene therapy.  It is also a measure of the effect of RBZ on CNV, and a term used in research to describe specific events related to blood vessel changes. \n\nCNV can manifest as various forms, including **Cataract Neovascularization** and **Myopic choroidal neovascularization**. It can be observed through different methods like laser-induced models or by analyzing cell number changes during inflammation.  The condition is also being followed up on and treated by ONS, a medical organization. \n\",18\n1146,HU02,\"Mice used in the study\nSpecific group of mice used in study\",2\n5030,NONRESPONDERS,,5\n4276,ONS,\"The **ONS** (Organization name) is a research-focused entity dedicated to developing and advancing therapies using **CNV** (Cancer Nanomedicine).  They are also known for their work in the field of **nanocarrier technology**, specifically in the development of nanocarriers for eye treatments. \n\",4\n4115,HRF,\"The **HRF** (Hyperechogenic Retinal Focal) exhibits a smaller height compared to type 2 in some cases.  This height is also linked to the occurrence of **PM-CNV recurrence**, suggesting its significance in predicting disease progression. Additionally, **HRF** can be identified through **OCT** imaging, where hyperreflective foci are observed. \n\",3\n4980,STR.ZOTOCIN,,3\n5018,CENTRAL SEROUS CHORIORETINOPATHY,A medical condition,2\n563,GINSENOSIDE RG1,A compound used in the study,1\n1457,TINU,\"**Tinnitus** (also known as **tinutis**) is a medical condition characterized by the perception of phantom sounds, often described as ringing, buzzing, hissing, or roaring. This condition can be complicated by changes in cell numbers within the body, specifically affecting the kidneys and eyes.  It's important to note that Tinnitus can also be associated with other conditions like **tubulointerstitial nephritis** (inflammation of the tubules and interstitium of the kidney) and **uveitis** (inflammation of the uvea, a layer of tissue in the eye). \n\",1\n4279,CURRENT THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES,,1\n4977,JP1,\"The **JP1** chemical compound is a potent inhibitor of **CNV** (presumably referring to cell-cycle progression or other cellular processes).

It is a pathological feature of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and can be detected using Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA).  This condition, often studied in research, involves the abnormal growth of blood vessels in the choroid, the layer of tissue beneath the retina. CNV models are used to test the efficacy of treatments like eNano-Ro5 for conditions such as exudative AMD. \n\",13\n4113,PM-CNV,\"The **PM-CNV** (pathologic myopia choroidal neovascularization) is a specific type of chromosomal variation known as a copy number variant (CNV). It is also classified as a type of cancer.  Specifically, PM-CNV refers to the development of abnormal blood vessels in the eye's choroid, which can lead to vision loss due to the increased pressure on the retina. \n\",10\n1465,BCVA,\"**BCVA (Baseline Visual Acuity)** is a measure of vision used in research. It represents the best-corrected visual acuity, which is a measurement of how well an individual can see clearly.  The BCVA was found to be better before and after treatment, indicating improvement in visual clarity. This measurement is also known as **best corrected visual acuity** and is often referred to as **Baseline Visual Acuity**. \n\",7\n3214,PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY,\"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a treatment option for several eye conditions, including central serous chorioretinopathy and nonresponders to other treatments.
