It has been shown to promote the proliferation, migration, and neovascularization of HRMECs (Human Retinal Microvascular Endothelial Cells). Notably, silencing this lncRNA has been observed to have negative effects on these processes. Furthermore, research suggests that **ATP2B2-IT2** is implicated in the pathogenesis of Diabetic Retinopathy. \n\",2\n972,MAPK4,\"The **MAPK4** protein is a key player in various cellular processes. It plays a role in regulating the cell cycle, contributing to both cell proliferation and tumor growth.  However, MAPK4 also exhibits an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, suggesting a complex regulatory function within cells. \n\",3\n107,VEGFR2,\"The **VEGFR2** gene encodes a protein that acts as a tyrosine kinase receptor.  This protein is crucial for angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels, and plays a significant role in vascular growth. VEGFR2 is also involved in the interaction with DCBLD2, and it's a target of the TDT-triVGB3 drug. It specifically binds to Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), making it a receptor for this angiogenic factor.  VEGFR2 is expressed on endothelial cells and tumor vessels, highlighting its importance in both healthy and pathological angiogenesis. \n\",8\n33,HIF1Α,\"The **HIF1α** protein is a crucial regulator of cellular processes, particularly in the context of oxygen levels. It plays a significant role in cell metabolism and angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels. HIF1α acts as a transcription factor, influencing gene expression to promote angiogenesis, a process vital for tissue growth and repair.  It also participates in the hypoxic response, adapting cellular function to low oxygen environments. \n\",7\n2189,DCBLD2,\"The **DCBLD2** protein is a transmembrane protein involved in angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels. It plays a crucial role in the interaction with the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), promoting VEGF signaling and ultimately leading to angiogenesis.  This interaction facilitates the process of blood vessel development by activating VEGFR2, which then triggers downstream signaling pathways that promote angiogenesis.  \n\",4\n106,VEGFR1,\"The **VEGFR1** protein is a tyrosine kinase receptor that plays a crucial role in angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels. It is a target of the TDT-triVGB3 treatment and is expressed on endothelial cells and tumor vessels.  VEGFR1 is involved in cell signaling and growth, making it an important factor in both normal physiological processes and cancer development. Notably, VEGFR1 has been identified as a hotspot for mutations in human proteins. \n\",3\n427,CD34,,2\n2240,NILOTINIB,\"Nilotinib is a BCR::ABL1 inhibitor. It increases spontaneous and VEGF-stimulated angiogenesis, meaning it promotes the formation of new blood vessels.  Nilotinib is also a drug that inhibits angiogenesis. \n\",4\n2169,HK2,\"The **HK2** gene is a protein-coding gene that plays a crucial role in cellular metabolism. It regulates both glycolysis, the process of breaking down glucose for energy, and NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH production, which is essential for various metabolic reactions.  Furthermore, HK2 is also involved in regulating angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels. \n\",1\n2174,TUMOR EC HYPERGLYCOLYSIS STATE,,1\n29,ERK1/2,\"ERK1/2, also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2, is a protein involved in various cellular processes. It plays a crucial role in cell growth and migration, acting as a key component of cell signaling pathways.  ERK1/2 participates in both normal cell function and tumor growth, contributing to cell signaling and potentially influencing the development of cancer. Additionally, it has been implicated in wound healing, highlighting its diverse functions within the body. \n\",4\n1357,RHGH,Recombinant human growth hormone,6\n1358,BURN MOUSE MODEL,A model of burn injury in mice used for research,1\n1359,INFLAMMATORY AND OXIDATIVE STRESS,,1\n1361,TGF-Β,\"The **TGF-β** (Transforming Growth Factor beta) is a protein that plays a crucial role in various biological processes. It acts as a pro-angiogenic factor, meaning it promotes the formation of new blood vessels, and is also involved in cell growth and development.  Furthermore, TGF-β is essential for wound healing, contributing to tissue repair and regeneration. \n\",1\n2239,PONATINIB,\"The **PONATINIB** is a BCR::ABL1 inhibitor, meaning it blocks the activity of the BCR::ABL1 protein. This protein is often found in leukemia cells and contributes to their uncontrolled growth.  Furthermore, PONATINIB has been shown to inhibit VEGF-induced sprouting, which refers to the process by which new blood vessels form in response to signals from the body's tissues. \n\",3\n2921,EGFA,\"The **EGFA** (abbreviation for  **EGF-related Factor Association**) is a research organization dedicated to understanding the interactions between VEGFR1 and VEGFR2.
