This process, also known as **vascular development**, encompasses the creation of new blood vessels from existing ones or through the growth of endothelial cells. \n\",3\n87,ENDOTHELIAL CELLS,\"**Endothelial cells** are cells that line the inside of blood vessels. They play a crucial role in various physiological processes, including angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels), blood vessel formation and maintenance, and blood flow regulation.  These cells are involved in both the structural development of blood vessels and their functional properties. Endothelial cells are studied extensively in research related to angiogenesis, as they are directly responsible for forming new blood vessels and responding to signals from other cells like bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells (BM-MNCs). They are also a key focus in understanding how blood vessels function and respond to various stimuli.  Endothelial cells can be derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells, offering potential for cell-based therapies and research models. \n\",22\n4685,FSCN1,\"The **FSCN1** protein is a crucial component in cellular processes, playing a role in both cell movement and ocular neovascularization.  It functions as an essential regulator of cell motility, enabling cells to navigate their environment effectively. In the context of the eye, FSCN1 is also implicated in the development of new blood vessels (neovascularization) within the retina, highlighting its significance in maintaining healthy vision. \n\",2\n299,H,Cell line treated with conditioned media from ESCs,1\n3352,LPS,\"**Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)** is a bacterial toxin that triggers inflammatory responses in cells.
