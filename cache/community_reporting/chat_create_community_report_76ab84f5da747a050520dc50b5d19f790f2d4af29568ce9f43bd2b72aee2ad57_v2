It can occur in various tissues and organs, including the retina, cornea, skin, and central nervous system. \n\n**Applications:**\n\n* **Retinal Health:** Neovascularization plays a role in preventing the progression of retinal diseases like retinopathy and outer retinal atrophy.  \n* **Diabetic Complications:** It is also involved in improving the diabetic microenvironment by reducing complications associated with diabetes.\n* **Central Nervous System:** Active neovascularization can be observed in the central nervous system, impacting its function. \n* **Eye Surgery:** Neovascularization is a factor in the formation of new blood vessels after cataract surgery, particularly in the iris.  \n* **Wound Healing:**  Neovascularization is involved in increased blood vessel growth at wound sites, contributing to tissue repair and regeneration.\n\n**Methods & Treatments:**\n\n* **PRP Treatment:** Neovascularization can be stimulated by platelet-rich plasma (PRP) treatment, leading to increased blood vessel formation. \n\n\n**Contradictions:** While some descriptions mention neovascularization in the central nervous system, others focus on its role in the retina and cornea.  It's important to note that neovascularization is a complex process with diverse applications across different tissues. \n\",12\n1917,DIABETIC SKIN WOUND,Type of wound related to diabetes,2\n1915,SKIN WOUND,A damaged area on the skin,1\n511,NEOVASCULAR AMD,,1\n1916,HUMAN UC-MSCSP,Stem cells used for treatment,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n146,EPO SIRNA,NEOVASCULARIZATION,\"Epo siRNA is a tool to target neovascularization\nEpo siRNA is used to study the effect of EPO on neovascularization\",14\n729,NEOVASCULARIZATION,DIABETIC SKIN WOUND,The process of increased blood vessel growth in the fresh skin tissue at a wound is associated with the healing of a skin wound,14\n728,NEOVASCULARIZATION,SKIN WOUND,The process of increased blood vessel growth in the fresh skin tissue at a wound is associated with the healing of a skin wound,13\n147,EPO SIRNA,NEOVASCULAR AMD,Epo siRNA is used to study the effect of EPO on neovascular AMD,3\n730,HUMAN UC-MSCSP,DIABETIC SKIN WOUND,Stem cells are used for treatment of diabetic skin wounds,3\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
