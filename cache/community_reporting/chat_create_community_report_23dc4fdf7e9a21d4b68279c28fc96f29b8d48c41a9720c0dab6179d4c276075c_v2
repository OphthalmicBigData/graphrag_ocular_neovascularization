They act as tubes that transport blood throughout the body.  Their involvement extends to various aspects of life, including growth (e.g., cancer), aging (e.g., degenerative changes in skin vessels), and even specific tissues like the **meniscus** and **retina**.  Blood vessels are also vital for supplying nutrients to hair follicles and tumors.  They were observed during examinations and play a significant role in the tumor microenvironment. \n\",11\n907,TUMOR GROWTH,\"**Tumour Growth**\n\nTumour growth is a biological process characterized by the uncontrolled multiplication of cells within the body. This process can be affected by various factors, including Rh2 and anti-angiogenic agents.  It involves both tumor development and expansion, leading to tumour growth and spread.  The rate of tumour growth can be slowed down by certain interventions like inhibiting angiogenesis (EC).
