They play a vital role in **angiogenesis**, the process of new blood vessel development, and are also involved in **wound healing**. EPCs contribute to the formation of new blood vessels by migrating to sites of injury or tissue damage. \n\",11\n67,PROLIFERATION,\"**Proliferation** is the process of cell growth and division, encompassing both cellular processes like **cell growth and division** and the multiplication of cells. This process can occur in various contexts, including **endothelial cells**, where it contributes to tissue development and repair.  It's also a key factor in tumorigenesis, as **proliferating** cells can rapidly multiply and form tumors. \n\nProliferation is often described as an uncontrolled growth of cells, which can be problematic when it leads to the formation of cancerous growths. \n\",4\n4648,PRECURSOR,,2\n4170,WOUNDED AREA,The area where the wound is located,1\n4649,PARACRINE ACTIVITY,,1\n900,CLINICAL STUDIES,Studies conducted on humans to understand platelet's role in cancer progression,1\n1276,NARINGENIN,\"Naringenin is a flavonoid compound studied for its potential to promote angiogenesis. It may also have alleviative effects on heart function and myocardial infarction (MI).  Research suggests naringenin provides protective effects against myocardial ischemia and reperfusion, suggesting it could be beneficial in treating these conditions. Additionally, studies indicate that naringenin increases viability in hypoxic human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), highlighting its potential for promoting cell survival under oxygen-deprived conditions. \n\",5\n1277,MI,\"The **MI** (short for Myocardial Infarction) is a condition that refers to the heart's inability to pump blood effectively.  It can be caused by a variety of factors, including coronary artery disease and heart attacks. The **MI** model is often used in research to study heart failure. \n\",4\n4787,ITGB2,Specific integrin protein involved in cell adhesion,8\n4790,ASCS,,1\n4788,ICAM-1,\"The **ICAM-1** (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1) is a protein that plays a role in cell adhesion.  It is specifically upregulated in the infarcted myocardium, meaning its levels increase after heart tissue damage occurs.

This damage can occur due to a blockage in an artery supplying blood to the heart, leading to reduced oxygen supply and ultimately cell death. The affected area is often referred to as the infarcted region. \n\",2\n58,MYOCARDIUM,\"The **myocardium** is the heart muscle tissue responsible for pumping blood throughout the body. It can be affected by various conditions, including ischemia (reduced blood flow to the heart).  This condition can lead to myocardial infarction (MI), also known as a heart attack, where the heart muscle tissue is damaged or destroyed.
