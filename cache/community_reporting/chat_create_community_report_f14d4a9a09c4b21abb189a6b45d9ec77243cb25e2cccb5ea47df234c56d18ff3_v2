It can cause a range of illnesses, from mild to severe, and often leads to respiratory illness.  The disease can also damage the body's endothelial cells, leading to further complications. COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic, and it causes long-haul COVID-19 symptoms in some individuals. \n\",4\n57,CHOROIDAL NEOVASCULARIZATION,\"**Chorioidal neovascularization (CNV)** is a medical condition affecting the eye. It involves the growth of new blood vessels within the choroid, a layer of tissue behind the retina. This process can lead to vision loss due to fluid build-up in the eye or other complications. CNV is often associated with various eye diseases and can be a rare complication of MEWDS (Malignant Endothelial Weal Disease).  It's considered a pathological feature that causes visual impairment, similar to how it mimics human CNV in mice. \n\",5\n2785,MEWDS,\"The **MEWDS** is a medical event characterized by visual symptoms in the eye.  It has been reported to resolve, meaning it no longer presents these symptoms. \n\",3\n1625,IMMUNOTHERAPY,\"Immunotherapy is a treatment method used to fight cancer. It works by boosting the immune system to attack and destroy cancerous cells.  It can be used for various types of cancer, including advanced SCCHN (squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck). Immunotherapies are also considered a type of treatment for cancer. \n\",3\n2086,ISCHEMIA,\"**ISCHEMIA** is a medical condition characterized by a lack of blood flow to the spinal cord.
