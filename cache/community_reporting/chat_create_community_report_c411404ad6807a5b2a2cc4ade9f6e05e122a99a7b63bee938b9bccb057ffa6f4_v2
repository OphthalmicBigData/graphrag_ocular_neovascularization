It is also known as \"\"Superb microvascular imaging.\"\" \n\",5\n126,NEOVASCULARIZATION,\"**Neovascularization** is a biological process that involves the formation of new blood vessels. It plays a significant role in various medical contexts, including treating diabetes and addressing cardiovascular conditions like carotid plaques.  \n\nThis process can be observed in several areas, such as the eye (where it contributes to abnormal blood vessel growth in the retina), the brain, and tumors. Neovascularization is also implicated in disease progression, contributing to tumor growth, metastasis, and radiotherapy resistance. \n\nIn the context of diabetes, neovascularization after diabetic ischemia is a significant area of research due to its potential impact on disease burden.  It can also influence plaque vulnerability in carotid arteries, making them more susceptible to rupture or other complications. Additionally, neovascularization plays a role in bone regeneration and may be used as a medical procedure for treating certain conditions. \n\n\n\",17\n2264,CEUS,\"The **CEUS** (contrast-enhanced ultrasound) is another sonography method used to analyze plaque neovascularization. \n\",5\n355,LYMPHANGIOLOGENESIS,Process of new lymphatic vessel formation,1\n790,EMBOLIZED VESSELS,\"Embolized vessels refer to blood vessels that have been obstructed or blocked, often due to a medical procedure.
