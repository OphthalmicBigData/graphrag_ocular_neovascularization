It is characterized by the presence of a mass of abnormal cells, often leading to tissue distortion and impacting normal bodily functions.  Tumors are subject to study due to their complex nature and potential for inhibiting angiogenesis, a process crucial for tumor growth. The **tumor microenvironment** plays a significant role in tumor development and progression. \n\nThe specific type of tumor being studied can vary widely, but all tumors share the common characteristic of abnormal cell growth.  \n\",8\n420,MACROPHAGES,\"## Macrophages: Immune Cells Involved in Healing and Inflammation\n\nMacrophages are a type of immune cell playing crucial roles in both health and disease.  They are involved in various processes, including **healing**, **regulating the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (nAMD)**, **wound healing**, and **inflammation**. These cells are found throughout the body, particularly in tissues like the brain, where they contribute to immune function. \n\nMacrophages are known for their ability to engulf pathogens, cellular debris, and foreign substances, acting as a first line of defense against infection.  They also play a significant role in **angiogenesis**, the formation of new blood vessels, and **inflammation**. Their influence extends to both **tumor growth** - where they can either help or hinder it - and the **tumor microenvironment**. \n\nMacrophages are particularly important in **ophthalmology**, where they contribute to fighting infection and promoting healing within the eye.  They are also being studied as potential targets for **targeted therapies** due to their ability to influence tumor growth.
