It refers to a group of diabetic foot ulcers that are particularly challenging to treat and often considered incurable. The study's focus is on developing treatments for otherwise incurable DFU, aiming to improve outcomes for patients suffering from this debilitating condition. \n\",8\n451,WOUND HEALING,\"**Wound healing** is the biological process that involves the formation of new blood vessels to repair damaged tissue. It encompasses various stages, including cell migration and invasion, which ultimately lead to the closure of wounds. This complex process promotes healing and can be studied using assays like cell proliferation and wound closure assays.  It's a crucial process for repairing damaged tissue after injury or illness. \n\",9\n79,STEM CELLS,\"**Stem cells** are a type of undifferentiated cell with the ability to develop into specialized cells.

It serves as a baseline for comparison, allowing researchers to assess the effects of interventions or treatments on a specific subject or phenomenon.  \n\nThis control group can be found in diverse contexts, including: \n\n* **Animal Studies:** In research involving mice, the Control Group is often comprised of mice not exposed to any specific treatment (e.g., a virus injection) or subjected to a standard diet. This allows for direct comparison with experimental groups that receive specific interventions.\n* **Human Clinical Trials:** The Control Group in human studies typically consists of individuals receiving standard care or no intervention, serving as a reference point against which the effects of new treatments are measured. \n* **Biological Research:**  The Control Group can also be used to compare the behavior or characteristics of cells or organisms under specific conditions. This group allows researchers to isolate and study the impact of particular factors on the subject being investigated.\n\nIn essence, the Control Group is a vital component in scientific research, providing a standard for comparison and ensuring that observed effects are truly attributable to the intervention or treatment being studied. \n\",10\n986,VEGETE,\"VEGF is a protein involved in blood vessel growth, which is important for tumor growth\",2\n2965,FLAP SURGERY,Surgical procedure for wound closure,2\n1129,THERAPY GROUPS,Groups that received therapy in the study,1\n4479,PCOLCE1<SUP>-/-</SUP> MICE,,1\n5096,DIABETIC FOOT PATIENTS,Patients with diabetes who have foot problems,1\n2381,GRANULATION TISSUE,\"Granulation tissue is a type of tissue that forms during wound healing.
