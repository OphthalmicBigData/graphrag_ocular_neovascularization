Neovascularization is a key factor in tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. It's essential for understanding how tumors progress and can be targeted by therapies aimed at inhibiting this process. \n\nThe descriptions highlight that neovascularization can occur as part of the healing process, specifically in the study group, or even under specific conditions like high-glucose levels.
