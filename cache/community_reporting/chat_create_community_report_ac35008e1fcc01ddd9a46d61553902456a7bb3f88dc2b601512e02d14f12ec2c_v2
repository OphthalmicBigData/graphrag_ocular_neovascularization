It is used to visualize the eye, study the retina, detect Central Nervous System (CNV) abnormalities, and diagnose CNV.  There are various types of OCT, including spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), which provides detailed retinal and choroidal imaging. OCT can also be combined with other techniques like OCT angiography (OCTA) to visualize blood vessels in the eye.  It is used for a variety of purposes, such as ophthalmic examination, studying aneurysmal lesions, analyzing the results of high-frequency photodynamic therapy (hf-PDT), and investigating the correlation between OCT findings and visual acuity outcomes. \n\",5\n4279,DRUSEN,\"Drusen are small, yellowish deposits found in the retina.
