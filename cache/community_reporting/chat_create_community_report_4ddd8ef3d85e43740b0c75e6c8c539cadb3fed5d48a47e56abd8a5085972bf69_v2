They possess the unique ability to differentiate into various cell types and are used for treating diseases. MSCs play a crucial role in wound healing by promoting tissue regeneration and repair. This is due to their ability to secrete growth factors and cytokines that stimulate cell proliferation and differentiation. The research on MSCs holds immense promise for developing new therapies for a wide range of conditions, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and autoimmune disorders.  The potential for MSC-based treatments stems from their ability to regenerate damaged tissues and modulate the immune system.
