This condition can be a significant cause of concern for individuals and families, often leading to emotional distress and uncertainty about future pregnancies.  It's important to note that recurrent pregnancy loss encompasses any pregnancy ending before 20 weeks of gestation. \n\",4\n1072,PLACENTA,\"The **placenta** is a vital organ that connects the mother's and baby's circulatory systems, facilitating nutrient and waste exchange. It plays a crucial role in supporting fetal development by providing oxygen and essential nutrients to the growing fetus.  The placenta also serves as a site for the production of growth factors like VEGFA and PLGF, which are critical for fetal development.  It is located within the uterus and is the primary location where fetal development occurs. Additionally, the placenta is often studied in relation to malaria research due to its role in fetal development and susceptibility to infection. \n\",4\n3232,MEDICALLY TERMINATED PREGNANCY,A pregnancy that is ended by medical intervention,4\n349,PLGF,\"The **PLGF** (Placental Growth Factor) is a growth factor that contributes to pathological angiogenesis, meaning the abnormal formation of blood vessels.
