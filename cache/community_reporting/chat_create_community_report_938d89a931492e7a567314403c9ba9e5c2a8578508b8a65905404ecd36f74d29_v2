It plays an important role in vision, as it helps to nourish and support the retina.  This layer is also involved in the process of light absorption and reflection, which are essential for clear vision. The choroid can be affected by age-related macular degeneration, a condition that affects central vision. \n\",4\n1037,ICNV,\"The **ICNV** (intraocular choroidal neovascularization) is a condition that can be treated with Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA).  Treatment often involves intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF drugs to address the underlying cause, which is typically choroidal neovascularization. \n\",3\n3706,VML,\"The **VML** chemical compound is a multifaceted entity with diverse roles in research. It serves as a tool for studying biological processes, acting as a lectin that influences DNA structure.  Furthermore, VML plays a crucial role in angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels. Notably, VML exhibits cytotoxic effects on lymphocytes and possesses genotoxic properties at high concentrations (8 μM), while also displaying antigenotoxic activity at lower concentrations (0.5 and 2 μM). \n\",10\n456,IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY,\"The **IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY** technique is a method used to study the structure and function of cells in tissue samples. It can be employed to investigate various aspects, including gene expression, protein expression, and tumor angiogenesis.  This technique allows researchers to detect protein expression within cells and tissues, providing valuable insights into cellular processes and disease mechanisms. \n\",2\n3707,LYMPHOCYTES,\"Lymphocytes are immune cells found in tumors and were studied in a specific context where they were treated with VML. \n\",1\n3709,TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR-ALPHA (TNF-Α),,1\n3710,0.5 ΜM,,1\n3711,2 ΜM,,1\n3712,8 ΜM,,1\n3713,LACTOSE,Sugar that reduces the angiogenic effect of VML,1\n1028,INFLAMMATORY CHOROIDAL NEOVASCULARIZATION,\"The **inflammatory chorioidal neovascularization** (ICNV) is a condition characterized by inflammation of the choroid and blood vessels within the eye. This inflammation can lead to leakage in the eye, potentially causing vision problems. \n\",1\n1038,EN FACE OCTA,\"The **EN FACE OCTA** is a specific type of OCTA (Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography) imaging technique. It refers to the particular way in which OCTA images are captured, specifically focusing on capturing cross-sectional views of the eye's anatomy from the front (en face).
