It plays a crucial role in angiogenesis studies, where it serves as an assay material. Matrigel is also utilized to create 3D models of the extracellular matrix, facilitating the study of angiogenesis in a more realistic and complex environment.  Furthermore, Matrigel is commonly used to culture endothelial cells for research purposes. \n\",2\n29,ENDOTHELIAL CELLS,\"Endothelial cells are cells found in blood vessels. They line the inner surface of blood vessels, forming a continuous layer known as the endothelium. These cells play crucial roles in blood vessel formation and growth, contributing to vascular development and maintenance.  Endothelial cells also interact with other cells and molecules, including those involved in the process of angiogenesis (blood vessel formation). Notably, endothelial cells are particularly sensitive to biological signals called \"\"BREs\"\" (likely referring to \"\"bradykinin receptors\"\"), which can influence their function and behavior.
