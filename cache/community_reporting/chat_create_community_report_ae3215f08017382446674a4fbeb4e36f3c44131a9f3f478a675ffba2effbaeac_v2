It plays a crucial role in preventing misfolded proteins from accumulating, which can lead to cell death. The XBP-1 protein is a transcription factor that regulates gene expression in response to ER stress. When the ER experiences stress, XBP-1 gets activated and promotes the production of chaperones and other proteins that help alleviate the stress.
