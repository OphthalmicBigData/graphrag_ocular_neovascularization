This process plays a crucial role in various physiological functions, including wound healing, organ development, and tissue repair.  It is also implicated in pathological conditions such as tumor growth, immune escape, and cardiovascular diseases like atherosclerosis. \n\nThe process involves the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, which form new capillaries and blood vessels. Angiogenesis can be triggered by a variety of factors, including hypoxia (low oxygen levels), inflammation, and growth factors.  It is essential for many biological processes, including embryonic development, organ remodeling, and wound healing. \n\nHowever, angiogenesis can also contribute to disease progression in certain contexts. For example, it plays a role in tumor growth and metastasis by providing the necessary blood supply for tumor cells to thrive. Additionally, its involvement in ischemic diseases like stroke highlights its importance in restoring blood flow and tissue repair.  \n\nResearch on angiogenesis has led to the development of targeted therapies aimed at inhibiting or modulating this process for therapeutic purposes. \n\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* **Definition:** Formation of new blood vessels\n* **Importance:** Essential for physiological processes, wound healing, organ growth, and disease progression\n* **Contextual Relevance:**  Angiogenesis is involved in tumor growth, immune escape, cardiovascular diseases, stroke recovery, and many other biological processes. \n\n\n\",123\n2194,CA-ADM,\"The **CA-ADM** entity is a location where studies focused on lesions.
