It's responsible for processing light and converting it into electrical signals that are sent to the brain for interpretation.  Located at the back of the eye, the retina contains specialized cells called photoreceptors that detect light and transmit this information to the optic nerve. The retina is also affected by various diseases and conditions, including ischemia-induced pathological neovascularization, where new abnormal blood vessels form. It can be affected by oxygen-induced retinopathy as well.  The retina is essential for vision and its function is vital for our ability to see. \n\",15\n953,TA,\"**Research Study on Treatment A for Inflammatory Retinal Events:**\n\nThe entity **TA**, also known as **Treatment A**, is a drug being studied for its effects on inflammatory retinal events.
