It can also refer to colorectal cancer cells, patients diagnosed with CRC, and the type of cancer itself.  Researchers study colorectal cancer cells and tissue samples to understand its development and progression. \n\",4\n3484,SPRY1,\"The **SPRY1** gene plays a role in both angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels) and bone regeneration.
