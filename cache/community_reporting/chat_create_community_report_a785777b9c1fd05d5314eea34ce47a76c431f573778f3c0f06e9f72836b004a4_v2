It is a biological entity that provides oxygen and nutrients for growth, and it is often associated with cancer.  Tumors can be found in various locations, including the site where anti-epidermal growth factor receptor, anti-BRAF, and antiangiogenics drugs are being used to treat cancer. They are also studied as a source of angiogenesis, which is the formation of new blood vessels. \n\n**Tumor** descriptions often include terms like \"\"growth of tumor,\"\" \"\"tumor tissue samples for study,\"\" \"\"tumor location,\"\" and \"\"tumors are abnormal growths of cells.\"\"  These descriptions highlight the nature of tumors as masses of abnormal cells that can grow and spread. \n\",12\n3694,NANOBODY,A type of antibody,4\n1636,AGRIN,\"**AGRIN** knockout mice are a specific type of mouse used in research.
