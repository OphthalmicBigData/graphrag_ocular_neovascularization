Immune cells, like macrophages, are involved in various stages of the body's response to cancer. Understanding how these cells interact with tumor cells is essential for developing effective cancer treatments.  For example, anti-angiogenic drugs can be used to inhibit angiogenesis, which is the formation of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow and spread.
