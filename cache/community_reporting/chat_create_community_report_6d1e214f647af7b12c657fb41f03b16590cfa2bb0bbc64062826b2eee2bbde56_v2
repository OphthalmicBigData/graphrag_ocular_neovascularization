It is a plant with medicinal properties and was used in the study mentioned. \n\",4\n1653,RAMRIS SCORES,,4\n361,INFLAMMATION,\"Inflammation is a biological process that occurs in response to injury or infection, and it plays a key role in the body's healing and defense mechanisms. It involves various cellular and molecular changes, including increased blood flow, immune cell recruitment, and release of inflammatory mediators. Inflammation can be triggered by both internal factors like infections and external factors like trauma.  Inflammation is linked to neovascularization in response to injury and ischemia, and it is a key factor in the development of conditions such as central vein occlusion (CNV). \n\nWhile inflammation grades were lower in groups 1 and 2, the process itself is essential for tissue repair and immune responses. Inflammation models have been used to study anti-inflammatory effects, with research focusing on substances like RsSO.  Inflammation can manifest in various locations, including the heart muscle (myocarditis) and the retina (diabetic retinopathy). It's a crucial part of the body's response to injury or infection, and its understanding is vital for treating various diseases. \n\",10\n714,Α-ZINGIBERENE,A chemical compound found in plants,3\n1651,ANGIOGENIC STRUCTURE,Structure that promotes blood vessel growth,2\n5576,TENDINOPATHIC INJURIES,Injuries to tendons,2\n2943,MIR-146B-5P,\"The MIR-146B-5P microRNA is a molecule that plays a role in wound healing.
