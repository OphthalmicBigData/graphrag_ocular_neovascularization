It is a structure studied in research and investigations related to the eye. \n\",4\n296,VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR,\"The **VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR (VEGF)** is a protein that plays a significant role in the development of various conditions, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It acts as a pro-tumorigenic factor by promoting angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels.  Specifically, VEGF has been linked to abnormal blood vessel growth in both age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and HCC.  Its involvement in placental angiogenesis further highlights its importance in vascular development. \n\",6\n2855,MYC,\"The **MYC** protein plays a significant role in various biological processes, including the development of lymphoma. It functions as a gene that promotes angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, and the expression of VEGFA, a protein involved in angiogenesis.

It can lead to irreversible vision loss, making it a leading cause of severe vision loss in people over 50 worldwide. AMD causes neovascularization, which involves the growth of new blood vessels in the macula. This process can damage the delicate tissue and ultimately result in vision loss. While the exact causes are not fully understood, AMD is associated with certain risk factors like age, genetics, and smoking.  \n\",3\n5602,FORKHEAD BOX PROTEIN P1,A transcription repressor involved in development,2\n3872,CLINICAL OCTA,Clinical imaging technique for studying eye diseases,1\n3883,WHITE WOMAN,A woman in her 90s,3\n3884,TYPE 3 NEOVASCULARIZATION,\"The **TYPE 3 NEOVASCULARIZATION** is a specific type of neovascularization.
