This process, often referred to as a hallmark of neovascular age-related macular degeneration, can lead to various complications, including pigment epitheliopathy.

The retina contains specialized cells called photoreceptors that detect light, as well as other cells involved in processing visual information. \n\nThe **retina** is also affected by age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of vision loss. It's been studied extensively in models like the oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model to understand how diseases affect the eye and develop potential treatments.
