It plays an important role in vision, as it helps to nourish and support the retina.  This layer is also involved in the process of light absorption and reflection, which are essential for clear vision. The choroid can be affected by age-related macular degeneration, a condition that affects central vision. \n\",5\n1037,ICNV,\"The **ICNV** (intraocular choroidal neovascularization) is a condition that can be treated with Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA).  Treatment often involves intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF drugs to address the underlying cause, which is typically choroidal neovascularization. \n\",3\n3774,VML,\"The **VML** chemical compound is a multifaceted entity with diverse roles in research. It serves as a tool for studying biological processes, acting as a lectin that influences DNA structure.  Furthermore, VML plays a crucial role in angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels. Notably, VML exhibits cytotoxic effects on lymphocytes and possesses genotoxic properties at high concentrations (8 μM), while also displaying antigenotoxic activity at lower concentrations (0.5 and 2 μM). \n\",11\n233,IL-6,\"The **IL-6** cytokine is a key player in various biological processes, including angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels) and immune response. It plays a significant role in both inflammatory responses and cancer development.  Specifically, IL-6 is involved in breast cancer progression by promoting angiogenesis.  It's also an important marker for inflammation, found in serum and synovial tissues.  IL-6 is classified as an inflammatory cytokine and its levels can be measured to assess the severity of inflammation or to monitor disease activity. \n\",3\n456,IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY,\"The **IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY** technique is a method used to study the structure and function of cells in tissue samples. It can be employed to investigate various aspects, including gene expression, protein expression, and tumor angiogenesis.  This technique allows researchers to detect protein expression within cells and tissues, providing valuable insights into cellular processes and disease mechanisms. \n\",2\n3775,LYMPHOCYTES,\"Lymphocytes are immune cells found in tumors and were studied in a specific context where they were treated with VML. \n\",1\n3777,TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR-ALPHA (TNF-Α),,1\n3778,0.5 ΜM,,1\n3779,2 ΜM,,1\n3780,8 ΜM,,1\n3781,LACTOSE,Sugar that reduces the angiogenic effect of VML,1\n3782,NEOVASCULARIZATION PROCESS,,1\n513,TNFΑ,\"Tumor necrosis factor alpha, a proinflammatory cytokine\",4\n232,IL-1Β,\"IL-1β is an inflammatory cytokine that plays a role in various physiological processes, including inflammation. It is found in serum and synovial tissues as an inflammation marker.  This cytokine is also known as an interleukine 1 beta (IL-1β) and is involved in the development of inflammatory responses. Measurement of IL-1β levels can be used to assess the severity of inflammation. Additionally, IL-1β has been identified as a tumor-related inflammatory cytokine. \n\",5\n2261,IL-17,\"The **IL-17** cytokine is another cytokine involved in inflammation.

This inflammation can lead to leakage in the eye, potentially causing vision problems. \n\",1\n1025,IFN-Γ,\"**IFN-γ (interferon gamma)** is an **inflammatory cytokine** involved in the immune response. It plays a role in both **tumor-related inflammation** and **immune responses**.  Measurement of IFN-γ levels can be used to assess various aspects of the immune system, including inflammatory processes. \n\",2\n2363,IL-18,Another type of inflammatory protein,1\n234,TNF-Α,\"**TNF-α (Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha)** is a **cytokine** that plays a crucial role in the inflammatory response. It is found in both serum and synovial tissues, serving as an **inflammation marker**.  TNF-α is classified as an **inflammatory cytokine**, meaning it contributes to the body's immune response during inflammation. Measuring TNF-α levels is a common method for assessing the severity of inflammation.  Furthermore, TNF-α is a **protein** that directly participates in inflammatory processes. \n\",4\n2426,INTERLEUKIN (IL)-1Β,,1\n1038,EN FACE OCTA,\"The **EN FACE OCTA** is a specific type of OCTA (Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography) imaging technique.
