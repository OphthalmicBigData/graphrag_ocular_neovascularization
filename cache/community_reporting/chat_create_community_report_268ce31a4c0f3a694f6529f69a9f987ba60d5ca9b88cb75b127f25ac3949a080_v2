Angiogenesis is a process by which new blood vessels are formed to supply nutrients and oxygen to growing tumors. This process is essential for tumor growth and metastasis.  Tumors can induce angiogenesis through various mechanisms, including the release of pro-angiogenic factors and the activation of endothelial cells.
