The report highlights specific examples of exosome delivery to different retinal layers, such as the inner retinal layer (IPL), inner nuclear layer (INL), and outer nuclear layer (ONL). This targeted delivery suggests a potential for precise treatment of specific retinal diseases.  For example, researchers are investigating the use of exosomes to deliver anti-inflammatory drugs to treat age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or to repair damaged retinal cells in retinitis pigmentosa (RP). The research community is actively exploring various methods for delivering exosomes to the retina, including intravitreal injection and gene therapy approaches.
