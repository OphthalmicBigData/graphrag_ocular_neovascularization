It plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including organ and tissue development, wound healing, bone repair, and tumor growth.  This process is also implicated in diseases such as cancer, inflammatory conditions, and ocular disorders. \n\n**Key aspects of angiogenesis include:**\n\n* **Formation of new blood vessels:** Angiogenesis involves the sprouting of endothelial cells from existing blood vessels to form new capillaries.\n* **Stimulation of new blood vessel growth:** Various factors can stimulate angiogenesis, including tumor cells, inflammation, and certain medications.\n* **Measurement and analysis:**  Angiogenesis is studied through various methods like immunofluorescence and tube formation assays. \n* **Impact on disease progression:** Angiogenesis contributes to the development and progression of many diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, and inflammatory conditions.\n\n**Specific roles of angiogenesis include:**\n\n* **Cancer:** Angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer and is essential for tumor growth and metastasis.  It involves the formation of new blood vessels that supply nutrients and oxygen to growing tumors.\n* **Wound healing:** Angiogenesis plays a crucial role in wound healing by promoting blood vessel formation, which delivers cells and nutrients to repair damaged tissues. \n* **Bone repair and regeneration:** Angiogenesis is essential for bone repair and regeneration, as it facilitates the delivery of cells and growth factors necessary for bone tissue development.\n* **Ocular diseases:** Angiogenesis plays a role in ocular diseases like dry AMD, where new blood vessels form in the eye to compensate for damage. \n\n**Research on angiogenesis:**\n\nAngiogenesis is a subject of extensive research, with scientists studying its mechanisms and potential therapeutic applications.  For example, anti-angiogenic drugs are being developed to inhibit tumor growth by blocking the formation of new blood vessels.\n\n\nIn summary, angiogenesis is a complex biological process that plays a vital role in various physiological processes, including development, wound healing, bone repair, and disease progression. Understanding the mechanisms and regulation of angiogenesis holds significant potential for developing novel therapeutic strategies for a wide range of diseases. \n\",152\n439,PLANT,Plant source for natural products,1\n440,ANIMAL,Animal source for natural products,1\n441,MICROORGANISM,Microorganism source for natural products,1\n491,SUBTYPE B,Subtype of tumor with higher angiogenesis regulators,1\n492,CCND2,\"The **CCND2** gene plays a role in both tumor development and angiogenesis regulation.
