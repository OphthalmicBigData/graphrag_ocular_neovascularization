It acts as a transcription factor, regulating gene expression and influencing cell signaling pathways. HIF-1α is particularly involved in the regulation of metabolism, angiogenesis, and bone regeneration.  \n\nHIF-1α is activated by hypoxia (low oxygen levels) and plays a significant role in the hypoxic adaptive response. This protein is also linked to cellular processes such as cell growth and survival, and it regulates gene expression under both normal and hypoxic conditions. \n\nHIF-1α's influence extends to various biological functions:\n* **Angiogenesis:** It promotes angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels) under hypoxic conditions.\n* **Metastasis:** HIF-1α is involved in regulating angiogenesis and metastasis, contributing to tumor growth and spread.\n* **Osteogenesis:**  It plays a role in bone regeneration by regulating osteogenesis (bone formation). \n* **Cellular Signaling:** It participates in cell signaling pathways, influencing cellular responses to hypoxia.\n\nHIF-1α is also linked to the immune response, specifically through its interaction with TLR4 and its influence on CNV (chronic neurodegenerative vascular disease).  \n\n\n**Contradictions:** The provided descriptions contain some contradictions, such as mentioning HIF-1α's role in both angiogenesis and bone regeneration. However, these can be resolved by understanding that HIF-1α is a complex protein involved in multiple processes, with its effects varying depending on the specific context. \n\",21\n2710,ADSCS,,10\n2416,TMTC3 PROMOTER,,1\n722,BONE REMODELING,Process of bone resorption and formation,4\n2711,BONE FORMATION,,2\n2713,BONE MODELING,,2\n2719,VEGF/AKT/MTOR PATHWAY,,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n23,HIF-1Α,VEGF,\"**HIF-1α** and **VEGF** are both proteins that play crucial roles in the process of angiogenesis, which is the formation of new blood vessels.
