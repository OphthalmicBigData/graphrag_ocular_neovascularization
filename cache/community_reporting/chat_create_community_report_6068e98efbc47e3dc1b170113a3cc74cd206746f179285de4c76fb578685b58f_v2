Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels, and it's crucial for supplying oxygen and nutrients to growing tumors. This process also facilitates the spread of cancer cells (metastasis) by creating a network of blood vessels that can transport them to distant sites in the body. The presence of angiogenesis often correlates with tumor progression and resistance to treatment.
