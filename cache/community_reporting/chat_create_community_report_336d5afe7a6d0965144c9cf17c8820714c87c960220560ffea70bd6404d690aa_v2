This process, often referred to as \"\"neovascularization,\"\" can lead to various complications, including blindness caused by corneal neovascularization.  CNV is a type of eye condition and a disease or condition being treated by EGF's nanomedicine. \n\nIt is important to note that CNV can be related to other conditions such as cataracts and corneal fibrosis. The process of CNV can also be studied using models like the laser-induced CNV model, which helps researchers understand age-related macular degeneration.  CNV can impair corneal transparency and visual acuity, leading to decreased vision. \n\nWhile some descriptions mention CNV occurring more often than expected, it's important to remember that this condition is not always present in a clinical setting.
