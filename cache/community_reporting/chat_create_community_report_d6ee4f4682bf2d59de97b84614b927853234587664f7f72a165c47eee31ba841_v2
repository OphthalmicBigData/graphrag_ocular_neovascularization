It is a disease process that can progress over time. \n\nCNV is studied in the context of research on diseases like cancer and its impact on the retina. It is also a medical finding, often observed as a result of laser injury or other factors affecting the choroid. CNV can be induced in animal models using an argon laser, such as in C57BL6 mice. \n\nCNV is a type of neovascularization in the eye and can lead to complications like lacquer cracks and patchy chorioretinal atrophy.
