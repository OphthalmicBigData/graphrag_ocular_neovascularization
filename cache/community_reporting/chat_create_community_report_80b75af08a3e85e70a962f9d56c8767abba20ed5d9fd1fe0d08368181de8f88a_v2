It can manifest as various eye conditions, including **choroidal neovascularization (CNV)**, which involves the abnormal growth of blood vessels in the retina. This condition can cause vision loss and necessitates treatment.  \n\nCNV is linked to oxidative stress and systemic inflammation, making it a complex medical condition that requires careful management. Research on CNV focuses on understanding its mechanisms and developing effective treatments, including potential therapies using DEX@INHANGs. Studies have been conducted in both humans and mice to investigate the effects of CNV treatment. \n\nCNV can be influenced by genetic variation, leading to changes in gene expression levels.  It is also associated with other eye conditions like cataracts and central nervous system vasculitis.
