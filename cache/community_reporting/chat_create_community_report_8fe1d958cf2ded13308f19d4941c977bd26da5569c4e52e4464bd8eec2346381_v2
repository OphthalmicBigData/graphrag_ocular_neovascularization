It's a target of research due to its involvement in cell growth and development, as well as its role in regulating metabolism and apoptosis (cell death).  FOXO1 influences both cell survival and the process of cell repair, including bone healing. This gene plays a significant role in cell growth and development, acting as a transcription factor that regulates these processes. It's also linked to diabetes and bone health. Notably, FOXO1 protein is involved in cell proliferation and death, and it can be phosphorylated by estrogen, influencing cell growth and proliferation. \n\",11\n405,DIABETIC MICE,Mice used for research on diabetes,1\n415,TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR,,1\n409,APOPTOTIC CHONDROCYTES,,2\n410,DIABETIC ANIMALS,,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n112,FOXO1,DIABETIC MICE,FOXO1 deletion partially rescued the low number of blood vessels in diabetic mice,12\n121,FOXO1,TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR,FOXO1 regulates TNF signaling and apoptosis,12\n120,APOPTOTIC CHONDROCYTES,DIABETIC ANIMALS,Diabetes increased apoptotic chondrocytes in diabetic animals,3\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
