It can cause vision loss and is often associated with other retinal conditions like Stargardt disease and age-related macular degeneration (AMD).  MNV is characterized by damage to the blood vessels in the macula, leading to inflammation and potential vision impairment. \n\nWhile MNV can be a rare complication of certain genetic disorders such as choroideraemia and rod-cone dystrophies, it can also occur independently. It's important to note that MNV is often diagnosed through medical examinations and follow-up assessments, particularly when the condition progresses to a more severe form known as T3 MNV (T3 Macular Neurovascular degeneration). \n\n\n**Note:** The term \"\"MNV\"\" can be used interchangeably with other terms like \"\"Myopic macular neuropathy,\"\" \"\"Myopic macular neovascularization,\"\" or \"\"Multi-nucleated virus.\"\"  \n\",19\n1623,INTRA VITREAL INJECTION,,2\n1545,PROANGIOGENIC MILIEU,The proangiogenic milieu is a biological environment that promotes blood vessel growth,1\n2224,STARGARDT DISEASE,Late-onset form of IRD,1\n2225,EXUDATIVE AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION (AMD),A type of vision loss,1\n2226,PERIPHERALINOPATHIES,,1\n2227,ANTI-VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR (ANTI-VEGF),,1\n2228,BESTROPHINOPATHIES,,1\n2229,ENHANCED S-CONE SYNDROME,,1\n3238,SE,Study area in the study,1\n3239,AXIAL LENGTH,Measurement used in the study,1\n4672,RAP,A specific type of retinal condition,1\n223,DIABETIC RETINOPATHY,\"**Diabetic retinopathy** is a condition that affects the eyes and can lead to vision loss.
