The entities are interconnected through a complex network of relationships, highlighting their significance in understanding stroke risk and treatment. Ischemic stroke is a serious condition that occurs when blood flow to the brain is blocked, often due to plaque buildup in arteries. Blood stasis, or clotting, can exacerbate this blockage, leading to increased stroke risk. Mild carotid stenosis, a narrowing of the carotid artery, also contributes to stroke risk by restricting blood flow to the brain.
