Currently, the primary treatment involves anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy, which significantly improves visual acuity in mCNV patients. However, challenges such as high recurrence rates and inconsistent therapeutic outcomes persist. Previous studies attributed mCNV to choroidal thinning and ischemia. Recent research suggests that, in addition to choroidal factors, perforating scleral vessels (\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gemma2:2b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_99d3e872d117041e16c0d77ea6c9b73a0cea7b6ca3fd6cd340a3780053481edb_v2"}
