However, most angiogenesis studies focus on model organisms. To test the relevance of angiogenesis to human cognitive aging, we evaluated associations of circulating blood markers of angiogenesis with brain aging trajectories in two deeply phenotyped human cohorts (n=435, age 74 + 9) with longitudinal cognitive assessments, biospecimens, structural brain imaging, and clinical data.
