While the immune response plays a pivotal role in orchestrating the intricate process of wound healing, excessive inflammation can hinder tissue repair. In this study, a bilayer alginate hydrogel system encapsulating polyelectrolyte complex nanoparticles (PCNs) loaded with anti-inflammatory cytokines and angiogenic growth factors is developed to address the challenges of chronic wound healing. The alginate hydrogel is designed using two distinct cross\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gemma2:2b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_1e1e2d3a860543bf462c7f292d9b58b20ad52c9508f449e9138d0f33564d6596_v2"}
