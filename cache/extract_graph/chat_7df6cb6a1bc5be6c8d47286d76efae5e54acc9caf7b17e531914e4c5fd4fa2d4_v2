SNARE complexes mediate the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells through MMPs which activate growth factors for ECM fragments by binding to integrin receptors. Increasing MMPs is in line with YKL40 since YKL40 is linked to promoting angiogenesis through VEGF and can increase ovarian cancer (OC) resistance to chemotropic and cell migration\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gemma2:2b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_7df6cb6a1bc5be6c8d47286d76efae5e54acc9caf7b17e531914e4c5fd4fa2d4_v2"}
