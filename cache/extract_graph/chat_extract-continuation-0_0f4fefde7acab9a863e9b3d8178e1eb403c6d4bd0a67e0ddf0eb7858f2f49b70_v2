What specific pathways or molecules are involved?\n* **Clinical relevance:** Can manipulating AMP and ADO levels have therapeutic implications for pregnancy complications like preeclampsia or preterm labor?\n* **Animal models:** Are there animal models that can be used to study the effects of AMP and ADO on placental vascularization in more detail? \n\n\n**Overall, this list provides a good starting point for exploring the complex relationship between AMP, ADO, and placental vascular density.** \n\n\n\n"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
