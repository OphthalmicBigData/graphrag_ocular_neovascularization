The role of miR-155 was explored using miR-155 mimics. In vivo, exposing the developing vasculature to miR-155 promoted hypersprouting, thus phenocopying defects associated with Notch deficiency. Mechanistically, miR-155 overexpression weakened Notch signaling by reducing Smad1/5 expression, leading to the formation of tip cell-like cells which\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gemma2:2b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_ac5f0ed44c6d16029a3e6e1e5fb391604f5e3878b51c47a6aa52653a3be68f50_v2"}
