Moreover, LOC101928222 was shown to promote migration, invasion, and angiogenesis in CRC. Mechanistically, LOC101928222 synergized with IGF2BP1 to stabilize HMGCS2 mRNA through an m6A-dependent pathway, leading to increased cholesterol synthesis and, ultimately, the promotion of CRC development.\n\nIn summary, these findings demonstrate a novel, LOC101\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gemma2:2b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_bed9e252b7afd7d45128235e24153dc79c9d2540f2f77d204156b06940c386b7_v2"}
