Taken together, our findings demonstrated that GLO1, AG, or NAC administration can ameliorate MG-induced angiogenesis dysfunction, and this can be mainly attributed to attenuated ROS production, reduced cellular apoptosis, and increased levels of angiogenic factors. Overall, this study suggested that GLO1, AG, or NAC may be promising candidate compounds for the treatment of angiogenesis dysfunction caused by hyperglycemia in diabetic ischemic stroke.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GLO1<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A chemical compound)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A chemical compound)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A chemical compound)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MG<|>EVENT<|>A condition that causes angiogenesis dysfunction)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANGIOGENESIS<|>EVENT<|>The process of new blood vessel formation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIABETIC ISCHEMIC STROKE<|>EVENT<|>A stroke caused by diabetes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROS<|>EVENT<|>Reactive oxygen species)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELLULAR Apoptosis<|>EVENT<|>Cell death)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANGIOGENIC FACTORS<|>EVENT<|>Proteins that promote blood vessel formation)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GLO1<|>NAC<|>The chemical compound GLO1 may be used in conjunction with NAC to treat angiogenesis dysfunction)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AG<|>NAC<|>The chemical compounds AG and NAC may be used together to treat angiogenesis dysfunction)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MG<|>ANGIOGENESIS<|>MG can cause angiogenesis dysfunction)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANGIOGENESIS<|>DIABETIC ISCHEMIC STROKE<|>Angiogenesis dysfunction is a factor in diabetic ischemic stroke) \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROS<|>CELLULAR Apoptosis<|>ROS production can lead to cellular apoptosis)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CELLULAR Apoptosis<|>ANGIOGENIC FACTORS<|>Cellular apoptosis can be caused by changes in angiogenic factors)\n<|COMPLETE|> \n\n\n"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
