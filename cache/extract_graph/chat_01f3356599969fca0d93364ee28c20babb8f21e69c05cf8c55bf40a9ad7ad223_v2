Furthermore, old <i>Bai3</i> knockout mice showed the degeneration of hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons in the basal turn. The results suggest that Bai3 plays a crucial role in the development and/or maintenance of pillar cells, which, in turn, are necessary for normal hearing function. Our results may contribute to understanding the mechanisms of hearing loss in human patients.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gemma2:2b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_01f3356599969fca0d93364ee28c20babb8f21e69c05cf8c55bf40a9ad7ad223_v2"}
