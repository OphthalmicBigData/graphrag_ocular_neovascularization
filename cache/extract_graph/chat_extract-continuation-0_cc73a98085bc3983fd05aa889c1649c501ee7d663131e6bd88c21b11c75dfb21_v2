Is there a way to simplify this? \n\n\n**Here's why:**\n\n* **Redundancy:** The relationship between \"mCNV-MA\" and \"Eyes\" is repeated in every line, which makes the output feel redundant. \n* **Lack of Context:**  Without context about what these variables represent, it's difficult to understand the purpose of this sequence.\n\n\n**Possible Solutions:**\n\n1. **Contextualize the Variables:** Provide a brief explanation of \"mCNV-MA\" and \"Eyes\" in your prompt. This will help others understand the relationship between them.\n2. **Simplify the Sequence:**  Instead of repeating the same relationship, consider using a more concise representation. For example:\n\n   * **Direct Relationship:** If you're simply stating that \"mCNV-MA\" is related to \"Eyes,\" you can use a direct statement like: \n     * \"mCNV-MA and Eyes are related.\"\n   * **Relationship Description:**  If there's a specific relationship, describe it concisely. For example:\n      * \"The mCNV-MA value influences the size of the eyes.\"\n\n3. **Use Abbreviations:** If you're working with technical terms, consider using abbreviations to save space and improve readability. \n\n\n**Please provide more context about your variables and what you want to achieve.** This will help me give you a more specific and helpful response. \n"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
