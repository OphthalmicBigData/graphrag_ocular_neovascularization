For example: \"CD39 and adenosine are related through [explain the relationship].\"\n2. **Repetition Reduction:**  Identify repetitive phrases or sentences and condense them. \n3. **Contextualization:** Provide context for each relationship to make it more meaningful. For example, \"The interaction between CD39 and adenosine plays a role in [explain the biological process].\"\n\n**Please provide me with more information about your goal.** \n\n* What is the purpose of this sequence? \n* Is there a specific audience you are targeting? \n\n\nThis will help me suggest the most appropriate solution for simplifying your text. \n"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
