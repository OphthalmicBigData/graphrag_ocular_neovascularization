how we can approach this, and I'll help you craft a clear message.\n\n\n**Understanding Your Goal:**\n\n* **What is your main point?** Are you trying to show that mRNA expression influences survival in CRC patients? \n* **Who is your audience?** This will determine the level of technical detail needed.  Are you writing for medical professionals, researchers, or a general audience?\n* **What kind of message do you want to convey?** Do you want to highlight a specific finding, raise awareness about a research topic, or simply explain a concept?\n\n**Possible Approaches:**\n\n1. **Focus on the mRNA Connection:**  You can explore how specific mRNA molecules (e.g., those related to cell growth, immune response, etc.) might influence CRC survival rates. \n2. **Highlight Research Findings:** If you have data showing a link between certain mRNA expression patterns and patient outcomes, you can present this information in a clear and concise way.  \n3. **Explain the Importance of mRNA Research:** You could discuss how understanding mRNA expression in CRC is crucial for developing new treatments and improving patient care. \n\n**Let's Get Started!**\n\nTo help me understand your goal better, please tell me:\n\n* What is the main message you want to convey?\n* Who is your target audience?\n* Do you have", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743215851, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 4000, "prompt_tokens": 1794, "total_tokens": 5794, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n \n-Steps-\n1.
