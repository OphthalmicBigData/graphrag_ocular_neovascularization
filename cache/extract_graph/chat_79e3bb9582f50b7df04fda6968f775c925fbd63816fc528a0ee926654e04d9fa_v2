Currently, an ideal predictor for not only prognosis but also drug sensitivity and immunotherapy responses in OS patients is urgently needed. Angiogenesis plays a crucial role in tumour progression, which suggests its immense potential for predicting prognosis and responses to immunotherapy for OS. Angiogenesis patterns in OS were explored in depth in this study to construct a prognostic model called ANGscore and clarify\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gemma2:2b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_79e3bb9582f50b7df04fda6968f775c925fbd63816fc528a0ee926654e04d9fa_v2"}
