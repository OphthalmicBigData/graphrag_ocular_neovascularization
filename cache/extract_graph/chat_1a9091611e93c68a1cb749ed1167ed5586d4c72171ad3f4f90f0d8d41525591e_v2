Using ribosome profiling, we found that HAX1 regulates the FAK pathway to influence microvessel formation and promote NPC metastasis by enhancing the translation efficiency of ITGB6. Our findings demonstrate that HAX1 can be used as an important biomarker for NPC metastasis, providing a novel basis for antiangiogenesis therapy in clinical settings.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gemma2:2b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_1a9091611e93c68a1cb749ed1167ed5586d4c72171ad3f4f90f0d8d41525591e_v2"}
