Is there a way to simplify it? \n\n\n**Here's why this is problematic:**\n\n* **Redundancy:** The same relationships are repeated multiple times, making the text unnecessarily verbose.\n* **Lack of context:**  The relationships themselves don't provide much insight into their significance or purpose. \n* **Difficult to analyze:**  The sheer length and repetition make it challenging to understand the overall message or identify key connections.\n\n\n**Possible Solutions:**\n\n1. **Summarize:** Can you condense the information into a shorter, more focused statement? For example: \"This sequence represents the complex interplay between PDAC cells and their microenvironment.\"\n2. **Categorization:**  Group similar relationships together to highlight patterns. \n3. **Visual Representation:** Consider using a diagram or graph to visually represent these relationships. This can make them easier to understand and analyze.\n\n\n**Please provide more context about the purpose of this sequence.** What are you trying to achieve with it? Knowing your goals will help me suggest the most effective solution for simplifying it. \n"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
