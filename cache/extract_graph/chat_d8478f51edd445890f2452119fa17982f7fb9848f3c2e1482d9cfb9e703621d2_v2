For instance, according to the current consensus, in the sprouting type of angiogenesis, there is no blood flow in the rising capillary sprout. However, it is known that biomechanical forces resulting from blood flow play a key role in these processes. Here, we present evidence for the existence of the intussusception type of angiogenesis during the postnatal development\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gemma2:2b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_d8478f51edd445890f2452119fa17982f7fb9848f3c2e1482d9cfb9e703621d2_v2"}
