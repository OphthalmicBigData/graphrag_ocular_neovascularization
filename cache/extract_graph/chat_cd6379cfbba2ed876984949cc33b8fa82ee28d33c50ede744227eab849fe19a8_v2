We found that iNO promotes angiogenesis in the developing white matter and cortex during a critical window in P14 rat pups. This shift in the developmental program of brain angiogenesis was not related to a regulation of NO synthases by exogenous NO exposure, nor the VEGF pathway or other angiogenic factors. The effects of iNO on brain angiogenesis were found to be mimicked by circulating nitrate/nitrite, suggesting that these carriers may play\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gemma2:2b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_cd6379cfbba2ed876984949cc33b8fa82ee28d33c50ede744227eab849fe19a8_v2"}
