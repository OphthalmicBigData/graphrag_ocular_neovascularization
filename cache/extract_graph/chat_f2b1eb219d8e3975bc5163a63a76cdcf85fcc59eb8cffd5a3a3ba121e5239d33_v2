In this study, the role of Embinin was investigated in LDH rat models. LDH model was established by lumbar epidural insertion of tail disc. Our results showed that Embinin promoted lumbar disc neovascularization, induced apoptosis of NP cells in LDH rats, and promoted lumbar disc resorption. Furthermore, mechanistic study showed that Embinin activated the cAMP pathway in the rat models. In conclusion, Embinin has\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gemma2:2b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_f2b1eb219d8e3975bc5163a63a76cdcf85fcc59eb8cffd5a3a3ba121e5239d33_v2"}
