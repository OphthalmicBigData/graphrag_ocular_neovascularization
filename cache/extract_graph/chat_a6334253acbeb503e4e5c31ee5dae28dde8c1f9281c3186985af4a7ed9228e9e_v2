NRP1 has been characterised as a coreceptor for class 3 semaphorins and several members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family. Because the VEGF family is the main regulator of blood and lymphatic vessel growth in addition to promoting neurogenesis, neuronal patterning, neuroprotection and glial growth, the role of NRP1 in these biological processes has been extensively investigated.
