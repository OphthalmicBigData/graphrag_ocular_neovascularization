Pathways Involved:**  The relationships highlight that various pathways are involved in both the development of cancer and the development of resistance to crizotinib. \n* **CCL20 as a Potential Target:** The list suggests CCL20 (a chemokine) might be a potential target for developing new treatments against crizotinib resistance.\n* **Angiogenesis Pathways:**  The list also emphasizes the role of angiogenesis pathways in cancer development and resistance to crizotinib. \n\n\n**How can this information be used?**\n\nThis information could be valuable for:\n\n* **Researchers:** This list provides a starting point for further research into the mechanisms of crizotinib resistance, particularly focusing on CCL20 and angiogenesis pathways.\n* **Drug Development:**  Understanding these pathways could lead to the development of new drugs that target these pathways to overcome crizotinib resistance. \n* **Clinical Practice:** This information can help clinicians make informed decisions about treatment strategies for patients with cancer who have developed resistance to crizotinib.\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like a deeper dive into any specific aspect or relationship! \n"},
