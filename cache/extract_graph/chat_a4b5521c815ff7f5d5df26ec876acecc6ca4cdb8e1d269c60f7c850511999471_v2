To understand the specific mechanism of RBM4 in detail, transcriptome sequencing, mass spectrometry and multiple molecular cytological studies were performed. These cellular level results were verified by experiments in animal models of nude mice. The increased expression of RBM4 in cancer tissues, suggested its use as a prognostic biomarker.
