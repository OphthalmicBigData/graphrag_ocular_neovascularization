Bacterial infection caused by the surrounding medical environment and equipment is also a major risk factor. The medical risk would be greatly reduced if we could develop an implant coating to guide tissue growth and promote antibacterial activity. Mesoporous bioactive glasses are mainly silicates with good osteoinductivity and have been used in medical dentistry and orthopedics for several decades.
