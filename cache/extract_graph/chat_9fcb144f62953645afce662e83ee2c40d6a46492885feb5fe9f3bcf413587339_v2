Exogenous administration of the Ago2 protein restored erectile function in diabetic mice by reducing reactive oxygen species production-signaling pathways (inducing eNOS Ser<sup>1177</sup>/NF-κB Ser<sup>536</sup> signaling) and improving cavernous endothelial angiogenesis, migration, and cell survival.
