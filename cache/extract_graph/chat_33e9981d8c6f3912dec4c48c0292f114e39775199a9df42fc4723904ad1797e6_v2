I don't need every single relationship, just the most important ones that contribute to this understanding. \n\n**How can we simplify?**\n\n1. **Focus on Key Relationships:** Identify the most significant relationships that directly influence the overall function or development of the system.\n2. **Prioritize Impact:** Prioritize relationships based on their potential impact on the system's functionality, such as:\n    * **Directly involved in gene expression:**  Relationships where Med23 directly regulates genes or proteins. \n    * **Indirectly impacts development:** Relationships that influence other pathways or processes crucial for development.\n3. **Use Visualizations:** Consider using a network diagram to visualize the relationships and their connections, making it easier to identify key players and their impact on the system.\n\n**Please provide guidance on how to simplify this list of relationships.** \n\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further clarification! \n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743138115, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2806, "prompt_tokens": 1789, "total_tokens": 4595, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n \n-Steps-\n1.
