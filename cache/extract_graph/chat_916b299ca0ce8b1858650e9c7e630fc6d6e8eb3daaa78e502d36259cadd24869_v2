Cellular mechanism that underlies the beneficial effect of LPCs in restoring blood supply and rescuing bone architecture was further explored using canine and mouse FHN animal models. We found that LPCs perfusion through the medial circumflex artery will promote the femoral head vascularization and bone structure significantly in both FHN patients and animal models. The HHS in LPCs treated patients was significantly improved relative to vehicle group.
