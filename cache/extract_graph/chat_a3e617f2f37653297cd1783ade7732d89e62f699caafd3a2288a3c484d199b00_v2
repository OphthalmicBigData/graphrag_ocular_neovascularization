However, the mechanism of its action is still unclear. This study first observed the inhibitory effect of PPII on cervical cancer cells (Hela) through the establishment of MTT and nude mouse subcutaneous transplantation tumor models. Afterwards, then, we collected Hela cell supernatant for culturing HUVEC cells and treated it with PPII.
