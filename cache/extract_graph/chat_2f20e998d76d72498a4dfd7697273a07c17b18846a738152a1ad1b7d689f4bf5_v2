Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is the most severe complication of PAD. In addition to medical and interventional treatment, therapeutic angiogenesis is a novel therapy for PAD. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) are considered key regulators of gene expression, but their role in ischemic-induced angiogenesis is poorly-characterized.
