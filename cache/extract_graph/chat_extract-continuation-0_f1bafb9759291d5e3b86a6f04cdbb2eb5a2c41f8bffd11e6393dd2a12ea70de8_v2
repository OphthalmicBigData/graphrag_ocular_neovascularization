This can make it easier to see connections and identify key relationships. \n3. **Keyword-Based Search:** Implement keyword search functionality to allow users to quickly find specific relationships based on keywords.\n\n**Please provide more context about your goal.**  Knowing what you want to achieve with this list will help me suggest the most appropriate solution for simplifying it.
