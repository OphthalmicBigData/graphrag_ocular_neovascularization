Machine learning and traditional statistics revealed sexually dimorphic associations of plasma angiogenic growth factors with brain aging outcomes, including executive function and gray matter atrophy. Specifically, markers of angiogenesis were associated with higher executive function and less brain atrophy in younger women (not men), a directionality of association that reversed around age 75.
