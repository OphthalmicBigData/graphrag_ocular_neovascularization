Recent research has highlighted the significant role of epigenetic modifications in regulating angiogenesis. This review comprehensively examines the current understanding of how epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs, influence angiogenic pathways in melanoma. DNA methylation, a key epigenetic modification, can silence angiogenesis\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gemma2:2b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_c65c0d478ea16d6b9301959beff856d48d51232e8f95e6e1dfe9d7c753509a0b_v2"}
