Is there a way to simplify this? \n\n\n**Here's why:**\n\n* **Redundancy:** The relationships between \"PBS\" and \"CORONARY LIGATION\" are repeated multiple times, making the text unnecessarily verbose.\n* **Lack of Context:**  The relationships seem to be about the impact of PBS on coronary ligation, but without context, it's difficult to understand their significance. \n\n**Possible Solutions:**\n\n1. **Condense Relationships:** Combine similar statements into a single statement for each relationship. For example: \"PBS may influence the outcome of coronary ligation.\"\n2. **Provide Context:**  Explain the relationships in more detail. What is PBS? How does it relate to coronary ligation? \n3. **Use Abbreviations:** If possible, use abbreviations like \"PBS\" and \"CORONARY LIGATION\" consistently throughout the text for brevity.\n\n**Example of Simplified Text:**\n\n\"PBS may influence the outcome of coronary ligation.\"\n\n\nPlease provide more context or information about the relationships you want to simplify so I can give you a more tailored solution. \n"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
