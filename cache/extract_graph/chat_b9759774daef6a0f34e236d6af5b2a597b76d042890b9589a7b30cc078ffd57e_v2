However, so far, there is no reliable solution for how to simultaneously visualize the relationship between tumor progression and angiogenesis. Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) has been broadly utilized and is a very promising non-invasive imaging technique with the advantages of low cost, high sensitivity, and robust specificity. In this chapter, we describe a dual bioluminescence imaging\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gemma2:2b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_b9759774daef6a0f34e236d6af5b2a597b76d042890b9589a7b30cc078ffd57e_v2"}
