Mechanistically, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-3α, as a target for miR-29cb2, inhibits HIF-1α activity by competitively bonding with HIF-1β. Notably, miR-29cb2 in peripheral blood (PB) nearly is undetectable in sham and significantly increases in ovariectomy mice. Further evaluation from osteoporosis patients demonstrates similar signatures.
