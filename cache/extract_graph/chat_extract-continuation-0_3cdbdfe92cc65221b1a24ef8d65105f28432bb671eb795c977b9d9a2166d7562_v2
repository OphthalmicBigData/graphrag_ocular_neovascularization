One of the major causes of delayed healing is the formation of insufficient vasculature. Precise regulation of blood vessels in bone and their interplay with especially osteogenic processes has become an emerging topic within the last years; nevertheless, regulation of angiogenesis in (early) diseased fracture repair is still widely unknown.
