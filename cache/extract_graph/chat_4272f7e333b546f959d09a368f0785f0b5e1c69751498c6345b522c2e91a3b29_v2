In this review, we explore the intricate mechanisms of angiogenesis that are crucial for DW recovery. We introduce a rational design for angiogenesis-enhancing drug delivery systems (DDS) and provide a comprehensive summary and discussion of diverse biomaterials that enhance angiogenesis for facilitating DW healing. Lastly, we address emerging challenges and prospects in angiogenesis-enhancing DDS for facilitating DW healing, aiming to offer a comprehensive understanding of this critical healthcare\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gemma2:2b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_4272f7e333b546f959d09a368f0785f0b5e1c69751498c6345b522c2e91a3b29_v2"}
