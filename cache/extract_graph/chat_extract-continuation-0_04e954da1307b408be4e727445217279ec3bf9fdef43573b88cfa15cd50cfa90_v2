\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`for` Loop:** The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence of values.  \n* **Values:** The values are not explicitly defined in the provided code, but you can replace them with your desired data. \n\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. **Initialization:** The loop starts by setting up an initial state for the iteration process (e.g., starting at a specific index or value).\n2. **Iteration:**  The loop repeatedly executes the code block within its curly braces (`{}`) for each value in the sequence. \n3. **Condition:** The loop continues to iterate as long as a condition is met, which determines when the loop should stop (e.g., reaching the end of the sequence).\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```python\nfor i in range(10):  # Iterates from 0 to 9\n    print(i)\n```\n\nThis code would print numbers from 0 to 9.\n\n\n**To use this loop, you need to provide the values it will iterate over.** \n\n\n\nLet me know if you have a specific set of values in mind or want to explore how to modify the loop's behavior!
