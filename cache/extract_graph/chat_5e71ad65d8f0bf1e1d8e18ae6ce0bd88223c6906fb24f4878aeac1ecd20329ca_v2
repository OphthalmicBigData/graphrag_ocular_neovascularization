The hydrogel's efficacy was superior to that of the common solvent group. Additionally, BMP4 thermosensitive hydrogel repaired ultrastructure, including microvilli, intercellular junctions, and damaged apical junctional complexes (AJCs), suggesting a potential mechanism by which the hydrogel prevented CNV formation.
