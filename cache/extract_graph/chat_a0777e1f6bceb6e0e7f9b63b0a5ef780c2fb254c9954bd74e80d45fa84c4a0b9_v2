Tumor angiogenesis is coordinated by the activation of both cancer cells and vascular endothelial cells. Whether the YAP signaling pathway can regulate the intercellular interaction between cancer cells and endothelial cells is essentially unknown.\n\nThe effects of YAP on tumor angiogenesis, migration, and proliferation of vascular endothelial cells were evaluated\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gemma2:2b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_a0777e1f6bceb6e0e7f9b63b0a5ef780c2fb254c9954bd74e80d45fa84c4a0b9_v2"}
