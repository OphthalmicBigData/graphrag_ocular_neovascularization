Our results highlighted the chemopreventive role of Dt already at low concentration (44.1 pM) and suggest that the Dt-induced cancer cell death occurred through oxidative stress mechanisms. This hypothesis was supported by variations on the expression of key genes and proteins. Oxidative stress cell deaths (e.g., ferroptosis) are recently described types of cell death that are closely related to the pathophysiological processes of many diseases, such as tumors.
