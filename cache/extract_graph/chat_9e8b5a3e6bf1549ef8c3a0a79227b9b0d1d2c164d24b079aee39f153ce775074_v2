Using in vivo laser-induced CNV models with mice and in vitro experiments with the human ARPE-19 cell line, we demonstrated that co-culturing neutrophils with ARPE-19 cells induces an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines and leads to S-phase cell cycle arrest, potentially through the induction of double-strand breaks (DSBs). Further exploration of this interaction revealed a potential pathway involving reactive oxygen species (ROS)\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gemma2:2b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_9e8b5a3e6bf1549ef8c3a0a79227b9b0d1d2c164d24b079aee39f153ce775074_v2"}
