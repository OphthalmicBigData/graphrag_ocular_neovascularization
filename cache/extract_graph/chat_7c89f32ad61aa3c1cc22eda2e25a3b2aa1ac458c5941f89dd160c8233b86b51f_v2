The challenges associated with these defects, including their complicated structure, inadequate blood supply, and limited availability of progenitor cells that hinder successful repair. To overcome these issues, we developed a novel approach using computer numerical control (CNC) material reduction manufacturing technology to produce a customized polyetheretherketone (PEEK) scaffold that conforms to the specific shape of orbital bone defects.
