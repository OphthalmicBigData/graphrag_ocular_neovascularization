and repetitive response. Is there a way to simplify this? \n\n\n**Here's why it's repetitive:**\n\n* **The same relationships are repeated multiple times.**  For example, you mention \"OCULAR SYMPATHETIC SUPPLY\" and \"LASER-INDUCED CNV\" in almost every relationship.\n* **There's no clear structure or organization.** The response feels like a list of statements without any overarching theme or connection.\n\n\n**How to simplify:**\n\n1. **Focus on the core relationships:**  Instead of listing all possible connections, identify the most important ones and explain them clearly. \n2. **Use concise language:** Avoid unnecessary repetition and use clear, direct wording.\n3. **Structure your response:** Use headings or bullet points to organize information and make it easier to read.\n\n\n**Example (Simplified):**\n\nThe relationships between \"OCULAR SYMPATHETIC SUPPLY\" and \"LASER-INDUCED CNV\" are complex and involve multiple factors. \n\n* **Direct connection:**  Laser-induced changes in the ocular sympathetic supply can directly impact the development of CNV.\n* **Indirect connection:** The ocular sympathetic supply plays a role in regulating blood flow to the retina, which is crucial for preventing CNV.\n\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* **Consider your audience:** Tailor your language and level of detail based on who you're writing for (e.g., medical professionals vs. general public).\n* **Use visuals if possible:**  A diagram or illustration can help visualize the relationships between these concepts. \n\n\n\nLet me know if you have a specific topic in mind, and I can provide more tailored examples! \n"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
