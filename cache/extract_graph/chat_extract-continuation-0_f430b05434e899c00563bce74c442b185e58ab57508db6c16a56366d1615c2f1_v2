Finally, the changes in blood vessels were verified by immunostaining. Both autoluminescence imaging and pathological staining confirmed that these two tumor models were successfully established. In vivo confocal fluorescence imaging found that the early tumor blood vessel structure had obvious characteristics: disorder, tortuous deformation, thin diameter, which were significantly different from the normal tissues.
