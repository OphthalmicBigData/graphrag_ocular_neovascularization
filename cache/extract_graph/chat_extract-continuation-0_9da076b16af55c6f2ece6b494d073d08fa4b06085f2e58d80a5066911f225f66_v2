I was missing crucial context about the specific entities and relationships you wanted to extract.  \n* **Specificity:** The prompt \"ONLY emit entities that match any of the previously extracted types\" is very important for me to understand your request. \n\n\n**How to Improve Future Requests:**\n\n1. **Clearer Prompt:** Provide a more detailed description of the entities and relationships you're interested in. For example, instead of just saying \"entities,\" specify what kind of entities you want (e.g., proteins, genes, cell types).\n2. **Context:**  If you have any specific research papers or data sets that you are working with, please share them so I can better understand the context and extract relevant information. \n\n\nI am constantly learning and improving!
