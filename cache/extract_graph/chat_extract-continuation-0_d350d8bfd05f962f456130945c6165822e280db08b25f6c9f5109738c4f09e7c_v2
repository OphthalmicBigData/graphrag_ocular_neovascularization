Can we consolidate them into fewer, more meaningful connections?\n2. **Prioritize Relationships:** What are the most important connections in terms of their impact on the system's overall function or behavior? \n3. **Visualize the Network:**  Can we use a graph or network diagram to represent these relationships visually? This can help us see patterns and identify key nodes (important elements) more easily.\n\n**Please let me know how you would like to proceed.** Do you have any specific questions about this list, or are you ready to start exploring ways to simplify it? \n"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
