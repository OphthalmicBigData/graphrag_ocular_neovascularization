In this review, we first elaborate on the effects of hypoxia on blood vessels from two different perspectives: (1) the promotion of angiogenesis and (2) cerebral microcirculation damage. We further discuss the factors influencing the dual role of hypoxia and emphasize the benefits of moderate hypoxic irritation and its potential application as an easy, safe, and effective treatment for multiple nervous system disorders.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##\n(\"entity\"<|>vasculogenesis<|>EVENT<|>A process that is essential to blood vessel formation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>hypoxia<|>EVENT<|>Lack of oxygen in the body)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>blood vessels<|>GEO<|>Structures that transport blood throughout the body)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>angiogenesis<|>EVENT<|>Process of new blood vessel formation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>cerebral microcirculation<|>GEO<|>Blood flow in the brain)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>nervous system disorders<|>EVENT<|>A group of diseases that affect the nervous system)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>vasculogenesis<|>blood vessels<|>Vasculogenesis is essential for blood vessel formation)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>hypoxia<|>angiogenesis<|>Hypoxia can promote angiogenesis)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>hypoxia<|>cerebral microcirculation damage<|>Hypoxia can cause damage to the brain's microcirculation)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>hypoxia<|>nervous system disorders<|>Hypoxia is a factor in some nervous system disorders)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>multiple nervous system disorders<|>Hypoxia has potential as a treatment for multiple nervous system disorders)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>moderate hypoxic irritation<|>Potential treatment for multiple nervous system disorders)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>hypoxia<|>blood vessels<|>Hypoxia can affect blood vessel formation and function)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>hypoxia<|>cerebral microcirculation<|>Hypoxia can damage the brain's microcirculation)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>hypoxia<|>nervous system disorders<|>Hypoxia is a factor in some nervous system disorders)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>multiple nervous system disorders<|>Hypoxia has potential as a treatment for multiple nervous system disorders)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>moderate hypoxic irritation<|>Potential treatment for multiple nervous system disorders)\n<|COMPLETE|> \n\n\n"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
