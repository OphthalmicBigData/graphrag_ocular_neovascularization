The antibacterial assay indicates good bacteria-killing properties under near infrared (NIR) irradiation due to synergistic effects of hyperthermia, reactive oxygens species (ROS), and SIM leaching. In vitro results demonstrate that NIR laser irradiation promotes the cytocompatibility, osteogenesis, and angiogenesis. The coating facilitates alkaline phosphatase activity and expedites extracellular matrix mineralization as well as expression of osteogenesis-related genes.
