Clinical practice has proven that EMS can effectively treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Previous studies have demonstrated that EMS regulates the functions of T cells and dendritic cells and affects the polarization of macrophages. However, it is not clear whether the inhibitory effect of EMS on RA is related to the regulation of abnormal synovial activation and angiogenesis.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##\n(\"entity\"<|>ER Miao San<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Er Miao San is a herbal formula for treating damp-heat syndrome)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RA<|>EVENT<|>Rheumatoid arthritis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>T cells<|>PERSON<|>Immune cells involved in the immune response)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Dendritic cells<|>PERSON<|>Immune cells that present antigens to T cells)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Macrophages<|>PERSON<|>Immune cells that engulf pathogens and cellular debris)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ER Miao San<|>DOWNWARDS FLOW OF DAMP-HEAT SYNDROME<|>Er Miao San is a formula for treating damp-heat syndrome)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMS<|>T CELLS<|>EMS regulates the functions of T cells)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMS<|>DENDRITIC CELLS<|>EMS affects the polarization of dendritic cells)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMS<|>MACROPhages<|>EMS affects the polarization of macrophages)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RA<|>SYNOVIAL ACTIVATION<|>EMS may inhibit abnormal synovial activation in RA)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RA<|>ANGIOGENESIS<|>EMS may inhibit angiogenesis in RA)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMS<|>RA<|>EMS may have an inhibitory effect on RA)\n<|COMPLETE|> \n\n\n"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
