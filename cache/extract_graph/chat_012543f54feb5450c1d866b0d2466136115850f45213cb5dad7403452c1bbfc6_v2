Our mechanistic study further reveals that SPP1 regulates the expression of PSMA through the transcription factor HIF1α. Moreover, SPP1 promotes HUVEC migration and tube formation. In addition, HIF1α knockdown reduces the expression of PSMA in HUVECs and blocks the ability of SPP1 to promote HUVEC migration and tube formation. We further confirm that SPP1 is abundantly\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gemma2:2b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_012543f54feb5450c1d866b0d2466136115850f45213cb5dad7403452c1bbfc6_v2"}
