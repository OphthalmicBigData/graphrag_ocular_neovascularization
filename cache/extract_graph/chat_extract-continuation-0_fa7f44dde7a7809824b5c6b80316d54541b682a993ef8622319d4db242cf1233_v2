In order to safely treat cancer patients and prevent immune checkpoint blockade-induced toxicities and autoimmunity, we suggest using anti-angiogenic drugs solely or combined with Immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs) to boost the safety and effectiveness of cancer therapy. As a consequence, there is significant and escalating attention to discovering techniques that target metabolism as a new method of cancer therapy.
