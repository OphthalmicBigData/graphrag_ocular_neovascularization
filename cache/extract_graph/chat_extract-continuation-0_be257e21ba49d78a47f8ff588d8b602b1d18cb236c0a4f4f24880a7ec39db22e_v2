In critical-size orthotopic calvaria defects, TG-VEGF effectively improved early vascular invasion, osteoprogenitor survival and differentiation, as well as bone repair compared to both controls and VEGF-expressing progenitors. In conclusion, homogenous distribution of matrix-associated VEGF protein preserves the physiological coupling of angiogenesis and osteogenesis, providing an attractive and clinically applicable strategy to engineer vascularized bone.
