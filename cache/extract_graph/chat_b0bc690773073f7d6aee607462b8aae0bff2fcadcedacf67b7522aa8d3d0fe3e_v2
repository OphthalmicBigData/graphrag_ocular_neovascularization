This can be achieved by external magnetic fields alone, or by their combination with magnetic materials such as nanoparticles, biocomposites, and coatings. Thus, this review is designed to summarize the studies on magnetic stimulation for bone regeneration. While providing information regarding the effects of magnetic fields on cells involved in bone tissue, this review discusses the advances made regarding the combination of magnetic fields with magnetic nanoparticles, magnetic scaffolds\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gemma2:2b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_b0bc690773073f7d6aee607462b8aae0bff2fcadcedacf67b7522aa8d3d0fe3e_v2"}
