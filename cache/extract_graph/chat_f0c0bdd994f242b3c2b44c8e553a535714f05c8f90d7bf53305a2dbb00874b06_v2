In addition, simultaneous neurogenesis and vascularization in bone tissue engineering have not been fully investigated. This article represents the first review on the effects of innervation in enhancing angiogenesis and osteogenesis in bone and dental tissue engineering. Cutting-edge research on the effects of innervation through biomaterials on bone and dental tissue repairs is reviewed. The effects of various nerve-related factors and cells on bone regeneration are discussed.
