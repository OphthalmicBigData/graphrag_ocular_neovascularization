Similarly, tumours generated by miR-146a-overexpressing BCa cells in mice grew rapidly with high levels of angiogenesis. BCa-derived EV treatment promoted the proliferation of endothelial cells via the inhibition of the demethylase TET2 and the subsequent increase in its downstream target c-Myc. These findings demonstrate that secreted miR-146a-5p contributes to cancer progression by promoting angiogenesis.
