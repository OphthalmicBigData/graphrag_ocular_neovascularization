However, comprehending the intricate intracellular and extracellular mechanisms underlying drug resistance remains elusive. Empirical investigations have elucidated that genetic aberrations, such as gene mutations, along with microenvironmental adaptation, notably angiogenesis, act as pivotal drivers of tumor progression and drug resistance. Nonetheless, mathematical models frequently compartmentalize these factors in isolation.
