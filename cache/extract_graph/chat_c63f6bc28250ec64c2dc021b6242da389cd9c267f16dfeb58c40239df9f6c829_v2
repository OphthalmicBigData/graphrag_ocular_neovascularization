It plays a significant role in angiogenesis and tumorigenesis and is regulated by interconnected VEGF and DLL4/Notch pathways. ELTD1 also modulates the JAK/STAT3/HIF-1α signaling axis, affecting the response of cells to low-oxygen conditions and promoting cell proliferation. However, their specific ligands and functional mechanisms remain unclear. ELTD1 expression is associated with different outcomes in various cancers.
