Is there a way to simplify it? \n\n\n**Here's why:**\n\n* **Redundancy:** The relationship between \"CIRCULAR RNAS\" and \"EXOSOMES\" is repeated multiple times. This repetition makes the text cumbersome and less efficient.\n* **Lack of Context:**  The relationships are presented as if they were a list, but without context, it's difficult to understand their significance or how they relate to each other. \n\n**Possible Solutions:**\n\n1. **Condense Relationships:** Instead of listing every relationship, focus on the most important ones and use concise language. For example:\n    * \"Circular RNAs are found in exosomes.\"\n    * \"Exosomes play a role in diabetic foot ulcers.\"\n2. **Contextualize Relationships:**  Provide more information about why these relationships exist. \n    * \"Circular RNAs are found in exosomes, which may contribute to the development of diabetic foot ulcers.\"\n3. **Use Visual Aids:** If possible, use diagrams or charts to visually represent the relationships between different elements. This can make the text easier to understand and follow.\n\n**Example of Simplified Text:**\n\n\"Circular RNAs are found within exosomes, potentially contributing to the development of diabetic foot ulcers. Exosomes play a role in this process.\"\n\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* **Use clear and concise language.** Avoid jargon or overly complex terms that may confuse readers.\n* **Organize your text logically.** Use headings, subheadings, and bullet points to break up large blocks of text and make it easier to read. \n* **Proofread carefully.**  Ensure there are no errors in grammar, spelling, or punctuation.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! \n"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
