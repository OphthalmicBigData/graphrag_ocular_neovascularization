We previously reported that rapamycin ameliorated corneal injury after alkali burns by methylation modification. In this study, we aimed to investigate the rapamycin-medicated mechanism against corneal inflammation and neovascularization. Our data showed that alkali burn could induce a range of different inflammatory response, including a stark upregulation of pro-inflammatory factor expression\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gemma2:2b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_a32f22bd0e479ecaa7d493df57ded237a1930dfa4ed4eb6f1531956d5974f7fa_v2"}
