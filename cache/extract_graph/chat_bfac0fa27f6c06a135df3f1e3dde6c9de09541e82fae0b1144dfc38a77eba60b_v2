However, to meet the urgent need for high-throughput studies and screening, further improvements are still required, particularly in terms of scaling-up. In this study, we combined microchip fabrication with the culture of three-dimensional (3D) spheroids, thus providing a platform for 3D multilayer angiogenesis-on-a-chip. Using this platform, we investigated the precise effects of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on angiogenesis.
