Is there a way to simplify this? \n\n\n**Here's why:**\n\n* **Redundancy:** The relationship between \"FUCOXANTHIN\" and \"VEGF-MEDIATED ANGIOMORPHISM\" is repeated in every line. This makes the output extremely redundant.\n* **Lack of Context:**  Without context, it's difficult to understand the purpose of this sequence. \n\n**Possible Solutions:**\n\n1. **Contextualize the Sequence:** Provide more information about what this sequence represents. Is it a list of relationships between molecules? A code for a specific process? \n2. **Simplify the Structure:**  Instead of repeating the same relationship, consider using a different structure to represent the connections:\n    * **Matrix/Table:** Create a table or matrix where each row represents \"FUCOXANTHIN\" and each column represents \"VEGF-MEDIATED ANGIOMORPHISM\". \n    * **Graph:** Use a graph to visually represent the relationships between molecules.\n\n**Please provide more context so I can give you a more specific solution.** \n\n\n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743338282, "model": "gemma2:2b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2610, "prompt_tokens": 1786, "total_tokens": 4396, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n \n-Steps-\n1.
