We further showed that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) transcriptional activity was mediated by a direct physical association between BI and PPARγ. Meanwhile, inhibition of PPARγ using lentivirus transfection of shRNA in human myeloma cell lines showed that the facilitation of PPARγ blocked angiogenesis and PPARγ repressed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) transcription.
